It’s not every day that a president proudly pursues an agenda that threatens to create a global recession. But that’s what President Donald Trump has done with his tariffs. Trump’s “liberation day” announcement featured new tariffs—long been derided by most economists—on almost all countries, including some uninhabited islands. In response, the stock market dropped and consumer confidence tanked at the prospect of snarled supply chains, higher prices, and a global growth slow-down. A week later, Trump blinked, lowering most of the new tariffs to 10% for the next 90 days, except for China, which faces a staggering 145% tariff rate.

The whole policy is a debacle based on a series of misconceptions and fumbled steps.

First, the entire premise of the tariffs—that we face a trade deficit crisis that requires drastic action—is plain wrong. A trade deficit simply means that we import (buy) more goods from other countries than we export (sell) to them. There is nothing inherently sinister about this. Trade deficits are not evidence of unfair trade barriers or discrimination. Instead, they arise naturally from the idea that there are gains from trade. For example, you run a trade deficit with your local grocery store, and your employer runs a trade deficit with you. Your life would be much more difficult and costly if you had to produce everything you wanted to consume—and the same is true for the nation as a whole.

In fact, the existence of U.S. trade deficits stems automatically from the fact that the United States is a good place to invest and thus attracts more capital investment from foreigners than it invests abroad. A country that imports capital will have to run trade deficits. This means that tariffs will not—indeed, cannot—eliminate trade deficits. Ironically, Trump’s own 2017 tax cut legislation made the United States a better place to invest, which, other things equal, raises trade deficits further.

Second, the claim that other countries will pay the tariffs is contradicted by the evidence. Tariffs are borne by American consumers and businesses and, in particular, by lower-income households, who tend to consume more imported goods as a share of their budget.

Third, the claim that other countries subsidize their exports and therefore we have to retaliate is incorrect. These countries apply value-added taxes (VATs). VATs are domestic consumption taxes, just like retail sales taxes. No one would charge retail sales tax on exports, and no one would consider not charging retail sales tax on exports to be an export subsidy. The same logic applies to a VAT. The VAT, however, is collected in chunks at each stage of production rather than in one fell swoop at the final sale. This means that, under a VAT, before a good is exported, some tax has already been collected on input sales earlier in the production process. So, it makes sense to rebate all tax on value added before export. This is not an export subsidy—it is just what is needed to ensure that a VAT only taxes domestic consumption.

This also shows why the claim that VATs discriminate against the United States—often summarized as “they tax our imports but we don’t tax theirs”—is invalid. If a German or U.S. automaker sells in the German market, they pay the German VAT. If they sell in Japan, they pay Japan’s VAT. If they sell in the United States, neither pays any VAT because the United States does not have a VAT. The German and U.S. automakers are treated equally in each case.

Fourth, the administration calculated the “tariff” that each country had created in a nonsensical way. Rather than looking at actual tax rates, the calculation effectively boiled down to the ratio of the total trade deficit with the country divided by the size of the country’s exports to the United States, which was then divided by two for the “reciprocal” rate. For example, if we, as a rich nation, import a lot of diamonds from a country like Botswana that is too poor to buy much of our stuff, the implied “tariff” rate is quite high (38% before last week’s walk-back). The most charitable explanation for this calculation is that some anti-tariff advocate in the administration tried to sabotage the policy by duping tariff supporters into using a silly formulation. No one in the administration seems to want to claim credit for the calculation.

More generally, Trump wants to use tariffs as a negotiating tool and as a permanent revenue source, but he can’t have it both ways. If tariffs are negotiating tools, they will be reduced when deals are made and, therefore, revenue will be lower than advertised. If they are tools, rolling them out all at the same time is a poor tactic, as it strengthens the negotiating position of other countries, relative to a situation where tariffs are imposed on one country at a time. If, in contrast, tariffs are meant to be a permanent revenue source, they can’t be a negotiating tool. And, of course, the stock market and consumer confidence reactions make clear that people view them as bad policy.

Certainly, the best course of action would be to end the whole plan, including the universal 10% tariffs. Even if the White House wanted to boost U.S. manufacturing, there are better ways to do so. But Trump might have backed himself into a corner, refusing to budge until trade deficits fall, when the only feasible way to lower them in aggregate is to reduce net capital inflows. So, we might be forced to keep this misguided policy and face the potentially vast economic consequences that result.

tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tariffs-on-all-imports-would-create-chaos-for-business/,Tariffs on all imports would create chaos for business,"Elijah Asdourian, David Wessel, Robin Brooks, Peter R. Orszag, William E. Murdock Iii, Jay Shambaugh, Ede Ijjasz-Vasquez, Landry Signé, Vera Songwe, Joshua P. Meltzer",,"If anything is clear in this turbulent election season, it is presidential candidate Donald Trump’s intention to levy high tariffs on all U.S. imports. Experience shows and economists agree that tariffs lead to persistently higher prices for customers. But the near-term damage will be even greater if massive disruptions in supply chains create chaos for businesses that rely on imports.

Trump has promised to increase tariffs on imports from China by 60 percentage points and on all other imports by 10 to 20 percentage points. His insistence that this would not make American consumers and businesses pay higher prices reflects a basic misunderstanding of how tariffs work in practice.

When an importer brings a good into the United States, it pays a tariff to the U.S. government equal to a percentage (for example, 10 or 20 percent) of the price paid to the foreign exporter. Importers have essentially three choices in this situation: (1) pass the tariff along to their customer, (2) eat the tariff and suffer lower profits, or (3) renegotiate contracts with suppliers or find and then switch to suppliers with lower prices (a costly process).

Some foreign exporters will doubtless lower their prices to stay competitive in U.S. markets, in which case foreigners would indeed bear part of the burden of the tariff (while the U.S. Treasury would collect less revenue from importers). However, studies of the duties levied during the last Trump administration show that price reductions by exporters were minimal at best.

Instead, the 2018–19 tariffs nearly always meant that, including the tariffs, U.S customers paid higher prices for the affected imported goods—in fact, prices that were higher by the full amount of the tariff.

The 2018–19 tariffs had other negative effects. The U.S. tariffs reduced exports of U.S. manufacturers that relied on imported intermediate goods because those U.S. companies couldn’t completely reconfigure their supply chains to offset higher costs. Trump’s tariffs also brought on retaliatory tariffs by other countries, which caused some U.S. exporters to substantially lower the prices they charged abroad to maintain foreign market share. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, which compiles concerns raised by the U.S. business community, mentioned tariffs 30 times in its 25-page November 2019 edition. Many respondents cited tariff and trade uncertainties as worries, while others complained about supply-chain disruptions, tariff-related cost increases, stock-building as a hedge against trade uncertainty, or pressure from clients to absorb the costs of tariff hikes through lower profit margins. A study of quarterly earnings calls of publicly traded companies in 2018 found that supply chain disruptions and raw material costs were the two most frequently mentioned concerns. In addition, global manufacturing contracted in the wake of Trump’s tariffs.

A less visible cost of the tariffs came from the frenzy of appeals for exemption. A bewildering array of politically favored importers won tariff relief from the Trump administration. This process imposed heavy costs on small- and medium-sized enterprises that were ill-equipped to jump through the bureaucratic and political hoops.

In thinking about how costly Trump’s proposed tariffs on all goods imports would be, consider this: He now wants to levy tariffs on more than 10 times the amount of imports as in his first trade war. The earlier Trump tariffs covered around $380 billion of U.S. imports, while goods imports totaled $3.1 trillion in 2023. Aside from inflation and other adverse macroeconomic effects, including the effects of retaliation from our trade partners, chaos would erupt in global supply chains as U.S. importers struggled to avoid the impacts of tariffs.

The repercussions of these tariffs would be felt by every firm that sells imported goods and by every firm that uses imported inputs to run its business. Prices will rise, production will be depressed, and employment will likely fall, particularly in sectors exposed to higher input prices or foreign retaliation.

What should worry us just as much, however, is the prospect of near-term chaos. Every importer and every purchaser of imported intermediate goods would shift attention from day-to-day business needs in their scramble to renegotiate contracts, reconfigure supply chains, and lobby for tariff exemptions—all in an uncertain, highly politicized trade environment. Thanks to the pandemic, we know what our economy looks like when supply chains are massively disrupted: Product costs spike, and shelves are empty. Why on earth would we want to repeat that mess?"
tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tariffs-wont-solve-u-s-mexico-drug-crime/,Tariffs won’t solve U.S.-Mexico drug crime,"Vanda Felbab-Brown, Joshua P. Meltzer, Dozie Ezi-Ashi, Maricarmen Barron Esper",,"The United States and Mexico urgently need to revitalize their partnership against cross-border crime, these authors argue, but President Trump’s threats to impose additional taxes on Mexican imports is the wrong way to do it. This piece was originally published by The Dallas Morning News .

What if Mexico threatened a 25 percent tariff on American corn and soybeans unless the U.S. stops providing an estimated $19 billion to $29 billion in yearly drug profits to Mexican criminal groups and blocks weapons trafficking to Mexico?

Mexicans can make a strong case that the illicit money, drug demand, and guns feed the violence and corruption plaguing their country. However, that would not be a constructive way to tackle shared problems.

Similarly counterproductive is the U.S. threat to put a 25 percent tax on Mexican car imports to the U.S., as President Donald Trump said, “if the drugs don’t stop or largely stop.” Those “Mexican cars” have on average 38 percent U.S. content. How many U.S. jobs would be hurt or lost?

But no doubt the United States and Mexico urgently need to revitalize their partnership against cross-border crime. This illegal commerce harms and kills far too many people on both sides of the border.

A task force of Mexican and American scholars and former officials prepared 13 key recommendations to take this vital work forward. The U.S.-Mexico Security Cooperation Taskforce, in which we participated, reviewed the last 10 years of bilateral cooperation and suggested priority steps to enhance progress against criminal operations. Going it alone is counterproductive.

U.S.-Mexico cooperation cannot solve drug demand in the U.S., nor can it solve the crime and violence in Mexico. Each government needs to manage its own challenges. However, better bilateral cooperation can strongly augment the capabilities of both. This requires swiftly forging a common action plan while working hard to build mutual understanding and trust.

Key steps include creating a senior-level coordination group, collaboration at federal and state levels, and strengthening joint criminal investigations. Building international liaison units and creating a U.S.-Mexico task force against fentanyl are equally vital. Both countries will benefit from community policing collaboration; enhancing cooperation on Central American criminal groups; avoiding clashes over marijuana policy; instituting better vetting against corruption; assuring frank dialogue on human rights; and strengthening collaboration against weapons trafficking and money laundering."

China is widely portrayed as the superior force in the ongoing trade dispute with the U. S. As someone who has worked on Russia sanctions extensively, this parallels a lot of commentary in the immediate wake of the Ukraine invasion, when “Fortress Russia” was a frequently used phrase and Putin was often portrayed as a mastermind. The reality—both for Russia and China—is quite different. As we’ve documented in a series of posts and a recent paper, Russia is uniquely vulnerable to the recent wave of sanctions on the shadow fleet. China’s export-dependent growth model is similarly vulnerable to tariffs. This post documents key aspects of China’s exports after the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Overall exports are stable, even though those to the U.S. have fallen sharply. That could reflect transshipments or it could be due to China genuinely exporting to new markets. As this post argues, either possibility amounts to a deflationary shock for China, where CPI (consumer price index) inflation is already zero. China’s transshipment of goods around US tariffs The remarkable thing about China’s overall exports is that they are up slightly so far in 2025 (Figure 1), even though direct exports to the U.S. have fallen sharply (Figure 2). The fall in direct exports to the U.S. is easy to understand. There is growing evidence that tariffs are pushing up prices for goods likely to be imported from China. Those price increases reduce demand for Chinese imports. It’s less clear why China’s exports to other countries have risen so much, essentially providing a full offset.

Figure 2 Source: Haver Analytics

There are two explanations for why China’s exports to countries other than the U.S. have risen. The first is that China is using countries like Thailand and Vietnam (among many) to transship goods to the U.S. I documented evidence to this effect in a recent post. The second is that China is genuinely exporting to new markets. Today’s just-in-time delivery chains are extremely lean, meaning that there is relatively little warehousing capacity. As a result, it would stand to reason that China may be selling goods that otherwise would have gone to the U.S. in new markets. There is plenty of evidence in this regard. Chinese exports to a wide array of countries have risen sharply, a rise that’s coincided with the imposition of U.S. tariffs. Figure 3 shows the example of Hungary and Figure 4 shows Albania, just two of many countries where this is happening. It is impossible to tell if these are transshipments or genuine exports to these countries, but—as far as the inflationary impulse to China’s exporters—that distinction does not matter.

Figure 3 Source: Haver Analytics

Figure 4 Source: Haver Analytics

It should be obvious why transshipments are a deflationary impulse. Routing goods to the U.S. via third countries is more costly than shipping them directly. This depresses margins and profitability, which is deflationary for China. Exports to new markets are similarly deflationary. A rise in exports due to U.S. tariffs amounts to a shift down and to the right of China’s supply curve of goods to the rest of the world (Figure 5). Since the rest of the world did not ask for this influx of goods, this amounts to a move down the demand curve (there is no shift up and to the right of the demand curve like there would be in the event of fiscal stimulus). China has to lower prices to generate demand for its goods. In either case, there is a deflationary impulse to its economy. This is significant because headline inflation is already zero (Figure 6). It will take very little to push China into outright deflation.

U.S. tariffs are similar and different. For the United States—a big net importer of goods—tariffs are without doubt an inflationary impulse, but for China and the eurozone—big net exporters to the U.S.—things look quite different. Goods that prior to recent tariffs would have gone to the U.S. are now stuck in China and the eurozone, where downward pressure on prices is likely to emerge. This blog reports on preliminary survey data, which suggest that this divergence in global inflation may be starting to play out.

Diverging global inflation due to US tariffs

Our work on inflation a year ago relied heavily on the S&P Global purchasing manager indices (PMIs), which are monthly balance-of-opinion surveys that include data on delivery delays due to supply chain disruptions, in addition to prices companies pay to suppliers and charge customers. These data come with all the caveats of survey data, most notably that they tend to “overreact” because—in the end—they capture sentiment and not hard data. However, it’s also true that these data proved themselves during the pandemic, providing an early snapshot of the severity of COVID-era inflation."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-tariffs-are-not-going-over-well-with-his-base/,Trump’s tariffs are not going over well with his base,"Elaine Kamarck, Joshua Gotbaum, Vanessa Williamson, Ellis Chen, Daniel S. Hamilton, Diana E. Páez, Yun Sun",,"During the first two months of his second term, President Donald Trump has shown that he is serious about bringing manufacturing production back to the United States—and that he is willing to use sweeping tariffs to make this happen. He cannot be surprised that his strategy is generating fierce opposition and retaliation from other countries. He may be surprised, however, that his tariffs are facing opposition at home, especially from the groups—young adults, non-college voters, individuals earning less than $50,000 per year, and Hispanics—whose votes put him over the top last November.

Every public opinion survey conducted in recent weeks supports this conclusion. For example, a CNN/SSRS poll released on March 12 found that 61% of Americans, and 72% of young adults, disapprove of the way Trump is handling tariffs. Fifty-nine percent of Americans without college degrees and 62% of those making less than $50,000 also registered their disapproval. Among white non-college voters, the heart of Trump’s coalition, the president managed only a 50-50 split. Of the Americans who voted for him in 2024, 20% disagree with his tariff policies. A Washington Post/IPSOS poll conducted in mid-February and a Quinnipiac poll released on March 13 produced nearly identical results.

Although Americans favor higher tariffs on China, they oppose imposing them on longtime friends and allies. For example, an Economist/YouGov survey conducted in the first week of March found only 32% support for tariffs on Canada, 33% for tariffs on the European Union, and 38% for tariffs on Mexico. Even a more targeted tariff on steel and aluminum garnered only 35% approval. In all these cases, young adults, Hispanics, and low-income voters were opposed by margins that exceeded the national average.

It is not hard to understand why so many Americans are opposed to higher tariffs. According to the Economist/YouGov survey, only 24% think that foreign countries and companies bear the cost of tariffs, while 54% think that it’s mostly American companies and consumers. In a remarkable agreement across partisan, ideological, and demographic lines, 68% of Americans believe that tariffs increase prices, compared to only 5% who say that they decrease prices and 8% who say that they have no effect on prices. This helps explain a key finding from a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll: Only 30% of Americans believe that “when the U.S. charges tariffs on imported goods, American workers come out ahead.”

In an unexpected move, the president’s Treasury secretary has confirmed some of these public doubts. In a recent address to the Economic Club of New York, Scott Bessant declared that “Access to cheap goods is not the essence of the American Dream.” Translation: Tariffs will raise prices here and now to promote Trump’s long-term goal of bringing manufacturing back to the United States. The president himself has acknowledged recently that there will be short-term pain and sacrifices on the road to realizing his economic vision and, in an interview on Fox last week, declined to rule out the possibility of a recession.

While economists are divided on Trump’s strategy, the American people aren’t. According to a CBS News/YouGov poll conducted at the end of February, 80% of the people believe that the president should give inflation a high priority, but only 29% think that he is doing so. For the economy as a whole, 82% think that it should be a high presidential priority, but only 36% think that it is.

The people believe that Trump is focusing on immigration, cutting government, and cultural issues—on everything except inflation and the economy. The president is gambling that they will be patient enough to endure high prices and even an economic slowdown to make American manufacturing great again. He could lose this bet."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/are-tariffs-big-techs-new-tool-against-eu-regulation/,Are tariffs Big Tech’s new tool against EU regulation?,"Tom Wheeler, Landry Signé, Andrew Dabalen, Ithiel Batumike, Fred Bauma, Jason Stearns, Jean-Claude Kassi Brou",,"Big Tech may have found their response to the European Union’s (EU) digital competition and content moderation policies: tariffs. “We’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in his announcement eliminating the company’s fact-checkers. President Trump, of course, has described himself as a “Tariff Man.”

Europe’s “ever-increasing number of laws, institutionalizing censorship” were number one on the Zuckerberg target list. The only way Meta “can push back on this global trend is with the support of the U.S. government,” he explained, adding, “that’s why it’s been so difficult over the past four years when even the U.S. government has pushed for censorship.”

The semantic conflation of curatorial responsibility and censorship, a familiar domestic political gambit, has been internationalized and weaponized to attack the expectation—at least in Europe—that media platforms like Meta should practice responsible content curation.

Tariffs and truth

Thanks to intensive lobbying by Big Tech, the U.S. Congress has done little to provide meaningful oversight of the digital platform companies. The tech CEOs invited to the Trump inaugural lead companies that dominate the free flow of information, invade personal privacy, and pervert the competitive marketplace. Yet, these companies have been able to avoid meaningful domestic oversight for their entire existence.

The void created by American inaction has been filled by EU regulations despite the companies’ strong objections. Combining claims of censorship with Donald Trump’s affinity for tariffs just might be the leverage Big Tech seeks against the EU’s digital policies. Mark Zuckerberg appears ready to spearhead the effort.

By framing the EU’s actions as “institutionalizing censorship,” and asserting that the EU is “going after American companies and pushing to censor more,” Zuckerberg presses all the right MAGA buttons to provide a rationale for the Trump administration to fight the EU’s decisions. It is not a surprising strategy, and is made even more significant because it reverses previous corporate policy.

After the January 6 insurrection, Facebook along with Twitter suspended Donald Trump’s account. “They shouldn’t be allowed to get away with this censoring and silencing,” President Trump said at the time. Accusing Zuckerberg of plotting against him, Trump wrote in a 2024 book that the Meta CEO could, “spend the rest of his life in prison.”

Meta’s 2025 policy switch, however, has been met with the new president’s approval. Asked if Meta was responding to his earlier threats, Trump replied, “probably,” adding, “I think they have come a long way.”

What’s the fuss over EU regulation?

The EU has enacted multiple laws to try and provide oversight of the previously unsupervised activities of Big Tech. It started in 2018 with privacy protection under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In 2022, the European Parliament passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA) to deal with the lack of digital marketplace competition. Twenty-twenty-four saw the AI Act (AI) establishing a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence.

All these actions were aggressively fought by Big Tech. But for social media companies, the EU legislation that is the biggest challenge is the 2022 Digital Services Act (DSA). This law covers a handful of online platform companies deemed pervasive enough to be “gatekeepers” with a new style of regulation.

Instead of the traditional form of regulatory oversight that micromanages how a company operates, the DSA establishes expectations for what the company will deliver. These expectations include content moderation and transparency. The law does not specify how moderation is achieved, but that it is being done in a meaningful and significant manner. Far from regulatory micromanagement of corporate operations, the companies are required to self-certify that they are delivering on the law’s expectations. If they are not, then there are penalties.

While Meta has eliminated fact-checking in the U.S., it has not done so in the EU. It is hard to certify content moderation, as the DSA requires, when you’ve fired all the moderators. This has created a conflict between the company’s U.S. practices and EU requirements. Even if it represents a legal problem, the decision is good for the company since social media platforms, such as Meta, thrive on engagement-stimulating, unedited rage, and bottom-line profits should increase with the elimination of fact-checking jobs.

Elon Musk and NATO—a signal?

Comments by Vice President Vance during the 2024 campaign hinted at leveraging the power of the federal government to deal with DSA requirements. Asked in an interview whether American support of NATO could hinge on whether the EU regulated Elon Musk’s social media platform X, Vance responded affirmatively.

“So, what America should be saying is, if NATO wants us to continue supporting them and NATO wants us to continue to be a good participant in this military alliance, why don’t you respect American values and respect free speech?” Vance said. “It’s insane that we would support a military alliance if that military alliance isn’t going to be pro-free speech. I think we can do both. But we’ve got to say American power comes with certain strings attached. One of those is respect free speech, especially in our European allies.”

These comments reveal a willingness to link trade and security to digital regulation. A tariff-based response to EU policies seems plausible under such a mindset.

A regulation vs. trade crusade?

On his first day as President of the United States, Donald Trump said “tariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary.” A few days later, he threatened the EU with tariffs unless they bought more U.S. oil and gas.

The U.S. has a trade deficit with the EU when it comes to goods such as oil and gas but a favorable trade balance when it comes to services such as those of Big Tech. The challenge, therefore, is not to use tariffs to force the EU to buy more, but, as Zuckerberg told the Joe Rogan podcast, “the United States should be defending its companies.”

Caught between a U.S. Congress that has done little to protect against misinformation and hate, and the world’s second largest trading block which has tried to combine freedom of expression and the expectation of curatorial responsibility, Big Tech faces a dilemma. The combined arguments of censorship and defending American companies is a powerful elixir served to an audience of one man.

Wall Street analysts hail Mark Zuckerberg as “the best CEO of our time” for his ability to align Meta’s self-interest with prevailing political winds. The emerging narrative of “censorship vs. trade” is a powerful, if calculated, political move. Threatening tariffs in response to EU digital regulations could be a strategy that appeals to “Tariff Man.”

Ironically, this push comes at a time when artificial intelligence offers low-cost tools for fact-checking and content moderation. Yet, the political calculus behind the “censorship vs. trade” strategy may overshadow technical realities.

Mark Zuckerberg’s maneuvering is a shrewd effort to redefine the debate about European digital regulation. The question now becomes whether President Trump will add relaxed enforcement of the EU’s digital laws—all of them—to his list of trade demands."

In the immediate aftermath of the U.S. election, we reviewed global markets for signs that tariffs were getting priced. At the time, the dollar had risen meaningfully, but that rise looked like it was driven by expectations of faster U.S. growth, not by markets putting meaningful probability on additional tariffs. This picture has grown even more pronounced since then, with the dollar rising further, but not versus currencies that would be most impacted by China tariffs, such as the Chinese yuan or Japanese yen. The conclusion remains, therefore, that markets price little tariff risk. We review the various moving parts of a tariff confrontation between the U.S. and China. A lot of this comes down to game theory, with China’s most potent weapon being depreciation of the yuan as an offset to additional U.S. tariffs. Such a depreciation could weigh on the S&P 500, causing spillback to the United States in the form of tighter financial conditions. The incoming administration may try to preempt this via sector-specific tariffs or—if it goes the path of a universal tariff—by phasing in such a tariff and making it conditional on certain benchmarks China must meet. Either way, given how little is priced, it seems likely that market volatility will rise in the months ahead. Markets price little tariff risk The dollar has risen substantially since the election (Figure 1), outperforming U.S. equities, which have lagged increasingly (Figure 2). The growing wedge between the dollar and S&P 500 lends itself to the interpretation that markets put a meaningful weight on tariffs. After all, many of the companies in the S&P 500 are multinationals that would be adversely impacted by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. However, that conclusion is misleading.

This is because the rise in the dollar is primarily against the euro and the British pound, while it has risen only modestly against China’s yuan (Figure 3), which has essentially been in a holding pattern since the election. Of course, some say that the yuan is subject to official intervention and may thus not be a good gauge for market positioning on tariffs. However, the Japanese yen sends the same signal. Japan would be severely impacted by additional U.S. tariffs on China, given that the resulting yuan depreciation would cause the yen to rise in trade-weighted terms. Such a rise would necessitate—in turn—a yen depreciation. Overall, it remains the case that markets are looking through tariff risk. Figure 3.

How will China react to further US tariffs? China’s most potent weapon in an escalating trade dispute is depreciation of its currency as an offset to U.S. tariffs. There is a precedent for this from 2018. Back then, the U.S. tariffed approximately half of all imports from China at a 25% rate, making the average tariff rate 12.5%. The yuan fell by almost that amount against the dollar in the months following tariff announcements (Figure 5), making for a de facto full offset via depreciation. 2018 ended with a sharp fall in the S&P 500 and prior instances of yuan depreciation—such as in August 2015 (Figure 6)—have also sparked declines in U.S. equities. Yuan depreciation therefore not only has the advantage of protecting China’s export sector from tariffs. It also harbors the potential for spillback to the U.S. by weighing on equities and thereby tightening financial conditions, something the incoming administration may not be happy to see. Figure 5.

It is not clear if China’s leadership is willing to let the yuan fall substantially, especially if U.S. tariffs are large. The rigidity of the yuan against the dollar in recent years suggests China’s leadership may be averse to such a tactic, perhaps because it sees a stable yuan as a symbol of Chinese strength. Proponents of a large, up-front yuan depreciation will no doubt point to capital flight in 2015/6, when China fought yuan depreciation, which fanned capital flight as it allowed depreciation expectations to build in China’s asset-rich middle class (Figure 7). Indeed, there are some indications that such capital flight is building again. Nonresident other investment flows—bank intermediated carry trades—saw unusually large outflows in 2024 (Figure 8), reminiscent of 2015, when the carry trade similarly unwound. There is no sign that resident outflows are happening in any material size at this stage, but those also took longer to materialize during the 2015/6 capital flight episode. Figure 7.

The incoming U.S. administration may well try to preempt a large fall in the yuan by imposing sector-specific tariffs or—if it resorts to universal tariffs—phasing those in, with upward steps in the tariff rate linked to performance benchmarks on China. Regardless, the fact that markets price little tariff risk means coming months may well be volatile."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/recent-tariffs-threaten-residential-construction/,Recent tariffs threaten residential construction,"Elena Patel, Aastha Rajan, Natalie Tomeh, Caren Grown, Jerome De Henau, Laura Martinez, Ipek Ilkkaracan, Aaron Klein, Alan Cui, Özlem Onaran",,"The U.S. faces a housing shortage measured in the millions of units, and families are struggling with historically high rents and home prices. The Trump administration has expressed a goal to reduce the cost of living and make housing more affordable, and may declare a national housing emergency. But it is also imposing new or elevated tariffs on lumber, gypsum, steel, and now, kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities, and other related products, the very materials that builders need to construct new homes.

These taxes raise costs across the board—whether for new construction, renovations, or affordable housing development. Using TPC’s tariff model, we calculated that current tariffs, including those just announced, will add roughly $30 billion to the costs of investment in residential structures. Our calculations show that about 90% of the costs to residential investment will fall on construction of new homes, including apartments.

They will also affect homeowners renovating their homes or doing normal maintenance. Likewise, buying appliances and furniture will become more expensive. Already for 2025, we calculate the prices of major appliances have gone up more than twice as fast as overall inflation, and living room, kitchen, and dining room furniture have gone up more than 75% faster.

Such costly tariff policies risk deepening the housing crisis.

Why have new and higher tariffs been imposed?

Temporary or targeted tariffs can safeguard a critical industry or respond to unfair trade practices. U.S. trade law provides two main paths for doing so. The first is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the executive branch to impose tariffs when imports are claimed to threaten national security. The second is designed to counter unfairly priced or subsidized imports, through the countervailing and anti-dumping provisions of the Tariff Act of 1930.

Tariffs on steel and aluminum follow the first path: In 2018, the Trump administration imposed Section 232 tariffs of 25%, citing national security concerns about the need to maintain domestic capacity. The Biden administration largely kept those tariffs in place, albeit with negotiated adjustments for some trading partners, and the second Trump administration doubled down. The national security rationale has been controversial: Some have raised questions about whether the risks these tariffs were meant to address were well-founded.

Tariffs on lumber have historically followed the second track. For decades, U.S. officials have imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on Canadian softwood lumber, arguing that subsidized access to timber allowed Canadian producers to undercut U.S. mills.

A new approach, and a third track, with costly consequences

The Trump administration is taking a new approach in 2025 by taking lumber and its “derivative products” down the national security track. That order imposes a 10% tariff on softwood timber and lumber, 25% on upholstered wooden products, and 25% on kitchen cabinets and vanities, effective October 14.

Furthermore, the tariffs on upholstered products, kitchen cabinets, and vanities—staples of residential construction versus defense production—are scheduled to rise again to 30% and 50% on January 1, 2026.

On top of these measures, the Trump administration has also used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which grants the executive branch power to regulate certain economic activity during a national emergency, to levy broad duties on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China. Announced in early 2025, these tariffs apply to a wide range of products, effectively adding another surcharge to many building materials that the U.S. imports in large quantities.

Gypsum—a mineral used in drywall—illustrates the risk to residential construction from IEEPA tariffs: More than half of U.S. gypsum imports come from Canada and Mexico. Doors, windows, and frames face similar IEEPA tariff pressures: A significant share of U.S. supply comes from Canada and China. Adding to builders’ and suppliers’ uncertainty: These tariffs remain on unsettled legal footing, since the constitutionality of this application of the IEEPA is now pending before the Supreme Court.

Taken together, these layered tariffs add significant costs to housing construction.

New and higher tariffs will exacerbate the residential housing crisis

The U.S. is short millions of homes, and the shortage affects every corner of the market. Analysis routinely finds that the U.S. is underbuilt by 3 to 5 million housing units relative to long-run demand. For example, Freddie Mac’s latest analysis puts the deficit at about 3.7 million units, while Brookings research estimates the gap to be 4.9 million. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, in its 2025 State of the Nation’s Housing report, highlights that new multifamily development is slowing despite record rents due to higher costs and that nearly half of renters are cost-burdened—spending over 30% of their income on housing.

The problem is even more acute at the bottom of the market: The National Low Income Housing Coalition estimates a shortage of more than 7 million affordable rental homes for extremely low-income households.

While methodologies differ, the broader research consensus is clear: The shortage is real, severe, and a central driver of today’s affordability crisis.

The Trump administration’s recent tariff actions expose a growing contradiction. Federal and state programs work to relieve the housing shortage. At every level of government, there are efforts underway to lower the cost of housing and expand supply, from the recent expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit in the tax bill passed this summer, to block grants that support housing and zoning reforms, and infrastructure investments designed to encourage new construction.

Tariffs on the very materials required to build new homes cut against efforts to build supply, add costs, and slow production. If the Trump administration aims to make housing more affordable, trade policy that seeks to protect the U.S. should support U.S. housing policy, not work against it."

Introduction Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, are a key part of President Trump’s policy agenda. Pharmaceuticals are among the sectors targeted for tariffs. The administration has highlighted at least two objectives for tariffs on pharmaceuticals: securing U.S. drug supply chains by onshoring drug production and creating U.S. manufacturing jobs. Understanding the impact of tariffs on pharmaceuticals is important because of the role prescription drugs play in the lives of Americans—61% of American adults (157M) and 20% of children (15M) fill at least one prescription each year through retail or mail pharmacies. Many of the same patients also get drugs administered in virtually all inpatient hospital stays. And millions of patients receive physician-administered drugs in the outpatient setting, for conditions like cancer or autoimmune diseases. At the time of writing this article, there are two potential versions for sector-wide pharmaceutical tariffs. One is a 25% across-the-board tariff on pharmaceuticals. The other comes in the form of not yet defined reciprocal tariffs that would reflect any subsidies, including tax treatments, that foreign governments use to support specific domestic industries. These proposed tariffs would supplement tariffs already in place on all Chinese products, set at 20% for pharmaceuticals, and 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican products. Although not spelled out in the announcements, the implied mechanism for accomplishing the administration’s goals can be summarized as follows: Tariffs push up the price that foreign products cost

As that price increases, demand shifts away from the more expensive foreign products towards domestic products

Domestic firms not only gain market share, but also increase their prices, further increasing their profits

Increased profitability of domestic manufacturers then encourages domestic manufacturers to expand their capacity and new manufacturers to set up production in the U.S., increasing U.S. employment. In this article, I discuss the extent to which this basic scenario is likely to play out as a result of contemplated tariffs by answering four questions: How might tariffs impact drug prices?

Will tariffs lead to onshoring of pharmaceutical production?

Will drug shortages result from tariffs?

Will tariffs help de-risk drug supply chains from China? To answer these questions, I first describe key structural dynamics in drug markets that will underpin my analysis. I distinguish between newer brand-name drugs, which are currently under patent protection, and generic off-patent drugs, which are inexpensive copies of older branded products that lost market exclusivity. I also describe the structure of the manufacturing part of drug supply chains and the role that FDA plays in overseeing manufacturing. The analysis of the four questions suggests that prices will rise across drugs if tariffs are extended to India and Europe, but the rise will not be for the full amount of the tariffs. The tariff pressure and political considerations will lead to many onshoring announcements for branded drugs. But we should not expect to see the same for generic drug makers because the return on investment for such major capital investments will be too low and uncertain. In turn, tariff pressure for both domestic and foreign manufacturers of generics will test their already low margins, potentially leading to product discontinuations or cost cutting that erodes quality. Any production disruptions in the already fragile generic injectable markets are likely to result in shortages. I conclude with a set of considerations for the Trump administration.

Prescription drug market dynamics relevant to tariff analysis To understand how tariffs might raise drug prices or lead to drug shortages, I first lay out some industry dynamics: the distinction between generic and branded drugs, how drug supply chains are organized, and the role of FDA in manufacturing quality oversight.

We spend money on brands but use generics When new drugs come to market, they benefit from market exclusivity that prevents others from making copies primarily because of patents. A branded drug may need to compete with other brands, but the level of competition is lower than when they face exact copycats. Once market exclusivity ends, generic and biosimilar versions can come on the market: generic for small molecule drugs, and biosimilar for biologic drugs. Of the about 257 large-molecule biologic drugs, about 6% have biosimilar competition. Of the about 2,900 approved small drug molecules, about half have generic competition. Within a year or two of generic entry, prices drop precipitously leading the off-patent branded version molecule to exit the market. Because older drugs are effective for many conditions and because of their price, Americans primarily take small molecule generic drugs. Generics represent 92% of U.S. retail and mail pharmacy prescriptions (Figure 1). They also represent about three-quarters of volume (doses) in the smaller hospital setting. In turn, spending goes towards patent-protected small molecule and biologic drugs—over 87% of overall invoice spending in the retail setting is on branded drugs. Invoice prices do not account for various discounts on branded products, but even if those discounts were 25-50%, the wide gap remains—we use generics and spend on brands.

Drug supply chains are complex The drugs distributed at a pharmacy counter or administered in a hospital are finished dosage form (FDF) drugs. FDF drugs contain one or more active ingredient (API) and between 3 to 10 excipients that have no therapeutic effect but either serve as fillers, diluents, or otherwise affect functionality of the product, such as stability or dissolution rate (see Figure 2). The API is product specific. It is the acetaminophen in Tylenol, semaglutide in Ozempic, or atorvastatin in Lipitor. API for small molecule drugs is chemically synthesized, often involving multiple steps, using a series of chemical reactions where key starting materials are transformed into intermediates and then API using various auxiliary agents that enable the chemical synthesis: reagents, solvents, and catalysts (see Figure 2). Biologic drugs are somewhat different in that the API step is complex but has fewer stages—it involves culturing the drug substance in living cells and then purifying that drug substance.

Figure 2: Typical drug supply chain for small molecule drugs

Note: Items marked in orange are not used exclusively in drug supply chains. For biologics, steps marked with * would be replaced with cell culture and purification, all done in one facility.

Relevant to supply chain resilience and onshoring costs is the fact that FDF can have different formulations, each using a different production process. Most of what consumers use are tablets and capsules, but many drugs are either injected or infused. There are also creams, oral solutions, drops, ointments, and other specialized formulations. Also relevant is that manufacturing processes for FDF can be specialized to type of formulation and type of drug, e.g., sterile injectables are made with very different machinery than oral dose products, some drugs are freeze-dried, some can be sterilized with heat, but others are made in a sterile environment, and some require dedicated lines or even buildings to prevent cross-contamination. What is relevant for segment-specific tariffs is that only FDF and API products are specific to pharmaceuticals, with the rest of the supply chain (marked in orange in Figure 2) shared with other industries. Excipients, such as starch, lactose, or titanium dioxide, are used in foods and cosmetics. Key starting materials and enabling chemicals are all fine chemicals with many industrial uses.

Where drugs are made varies by type and stage Generic solid oral dose drugs have the largest footprint with American patients. These drugs include statins for high cholesterol, multiple blood pressure medications, metformin for blood sugar control, levothyroxine for thyroid disorder, and SSRI drugs for depression and anxiety. About 187 billion generic drug tablets and capsules were dispensed in retail and mail pharmacies in 2024 (source data from Figure 3), equating to about 550 pills per person or 1.5 chronic medications. As Figure 3 indicates, generic solid oral drugs are now primarily made in India. The U.S. makes 22% unit share of generic solid oral dose drugs, a big share of it controlled substances like opioids and ADHD medications, due to Drug Enforcement Agency requirements that those products are domestically produced. China represents a 3.5% unit share, which is less than Europe’s 5.4% unit share. Sterile injectable generics, such as IV antibiotics, saline, chemotherapy agents, lidocaine, and epinephrine, are still largely made in the U.S. (Figure 3). Part of it has to do with the complexity of production relative to oral dose products and the much higher transportation costs for such drugs. But offshoring has followed, with India taking a leading role in the trend, currently at 20.9% unit share. China is almost on par with Europe when it comes to generic injectables, 11.8% and 12.7% respectively.

What is more difficult to ascertain is where API for generics comes from. Using FDA Generic Drug User Fee Act facility payment data, we can assess the location of facilities making FDF and API for generic drugs. A comparison between FDF and API is particularly instructive. As Figure 4 indicates, the U.S. has the highest share of FDF facilities, but its share of API facilities is less than half of what Europe and India have. Even China has more generic API facilities than the U.S.

Figure 4: Generic facilities by stage of production (2025)

Source: FDA GDUFA facility fee payments (2025) Note: Some facilities produce FDF and API and are counted in both

It is important to note that Figures 3 and 4 show geographic distribution across all drugs, but geographic distribution for a given drug molecule may be far from what those figures represent. For example, underlying Figure 3 is U.S.-based Baxter with a 60% market share of 1L saline bags, U.S.-based Hospira with a 50% market share of injectable morphine, and Indian-based Intas with a 50% market share of carboplatin. Sources of API may vary across drugs or therapeutic classes. One analysis of 32 essential medicines found that steroids had API sourced almost exclusively in Europe, API for anticonvulsants came primarily from India, and production for API dialysis agents was split between the U.S. and Europe. There is lack of visibility into where inactive ingredients and starting materials for API come from. Discussions with industry executives suggest that excipients largely come from the U.S. and other OECD countries, but China dominates the fine chemicals market which includes key starting materials and auxiliary chemicals needed for chemical synthesis of intermediates and APIs (Figure 2). The FDF location picture (Figure 5 below) looks dramatically different for brands—the U.S. leads in both oral dose and injectable markets, India’s footprint is minimal, and China’s is basically nonexistent. Canada and Mexico (listed in Other) play a greater role in oral dose markets, with 1.8% and 2.4% share overall. Europe plays a significant role, with almost a third of units sold in both market segments. Data underlying Figure 5 suggests that Ireland leads with more than a third of Europe’s exports of branded oral dose drugs. Among injectables, leading European exports are Denmark, Germany, and Italy. The high declared value of branded drugs has helped make pharmaceuticals When interpreting these shares, it is important to keep in mind that they are aggregated across all branded drugs. For a given brand-name drug with no generic competition, it is quite likely that production is concentrated to one or two manufacturing sites, and chances are that the share of brands produced both in the U.S. and abroad is relatively small.

The picture on the brand API side (Figure 6) has a similar shift to that we see when we look at API generic—the U.S. has a smaller footprint than on the FDF side, Europe has a larger one, as does China. As with generic API data, the data are not volume weighted.

Active ingredient location is center stage for tariffs on pharmaceuticals When goods enter a U.S. port of entry, they are classified using a standardized system called the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). Importers classify their goods according to the HTS and declare their value or quantity. The applicable duty or tariff they then owed to the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is based on the HTS classification and the country of origin. The determination of the country of origin and, therefore, the appropriate duty or tariff is not straightforward in that the country of origin is not necessarily where the product is imported from. Instead, the country of origin is determined by where substantial transformation of the product happened. In some cases, the substantial transformation is relatively obvious—cars made in Germany are a product of Germany, even if parts (engine, tires, airbags) come from other countries. In other cases, substantial transformation might be before the final product. For example, if Brazilian nuts are mixed with salt and packaged in Australia, they are a product of Brazil. The country of origin for prescription drugs follows the nuts example more closely than the cars example. CBP has long ruled that mixing ingredients into the final drug form does not substantially transform the API and therefore the country of origin is the API source. This means that an FDF drug coming from India will pay the Chinese tariff rate if it contains API made in China. The determination for the country of origin is different for government procurement rules. There are exceptions to the API-based country of origin, either because substantial transformation takes place elsewhere in the supply chain or because of trade agreements. Drugs that involve multiple APIs will have the mixing stage as the country of origin. The complexity of the production process can also shift substantial transformation up or down from the API stage. For example, processing of APIs not suitable for human consumption, as with purifying and freeze-drying vancomycin, has been ruled to constitute the FDF be substantial transformation. The rules for products under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) can also differ. Nonetheless, it is quite reasonable to use the API production country as the country of origin for single-API drugs finished in countries other than Mexico or Canada. Of note, however, is that these rules could change.

Manufacturing of drugs has strict manufacturing standards for good reasons As we consider the response from firms to tariffs, whether it is in terms of cutting costs or onshoring their supply chains, it is important to understand the role of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA plays a critical role in addressing a major information gap resulting from the patients’ and physicians’ inability to observe drug product integrity, not only before consumption, but also after. Not every drug works the same for every patient, and the patient’s condition or response to the drug may change over time for physiological reasons. Because of that, when a patient stops responding to blood pressure medication, the physician will think to switch the patient to a different drug without suspecting that the drug may not be manufactured properly. FDA requires that manufacturers of approved drugs (brands and generics) follow regulatory standards for ensuring the identity, strength, quality, and purity of drugs. This set of standards, called the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP), covers a broad range of controls over how drugs are manufactured. This includes establishing strong quality management systems, ensuring quality raw materials, having written operating procedures, identifying and investigating product quality problems, and maintaining reliable testing laboratories. This framework evolved as a result of many crises and many hundreds of deaths of Americans exposed to contaminated or substandard drugs. But as with any laws, enforcement is key. To assure that manufacturers follow CGMP standards, new-to-market drugs (brands and generics alike) must establish that their production process can reliably replicate the drug matching the safety and efficacy claims made on the drug label. FDA generally establishes that through pre-approval inspections of API and FDF facilities, but FDA might forgo a pre-approval inspection if it has reliable information about the facility and processes from other sources. Once the product is on the market, FDA conducts surveillance inspections to assess compliance with manufacturing processes and the integrity of products on the market. FDA also makes sure that any changes to the API or FDF production process do not alter the product’s safety or efficacy. FDA requires manufacturers to report manufacturing process or setting changes, the more consequential of which may require an FDA inspection.

How might tariffs impact drug prices? Two main factors determine whether tariffs will increase prices: tariff exposure and the ability of manufacturers to pass on price increases. Tariff exposure reflects the extent to which production of a given drug is exposed to various tariffs. For a brand-name drug, the exposure may be quite uniform because there is only one version of the drug on the market, so it may be produced at just one site. For a generic drug, the exposure may vary because there may be many generic versions of a drug. In the context of tariff exposure, it is worth underscoring the importance of API location. Under the current CBP rules, the country of API manufacture is generally the country of origin for a single-API drug not made in Canada or Mexico. The ability to pass on tariffs onto buyers will depend on how competitive the markets are, how constrained production is in the short term, and the extent to which there are contracts or government regulations that limit manufacturer’s ability to raise prices. These factors will differ for brand-name drugs, generic oral dose drugs, and generic injectable drugs. For that reason, my analysis addresses these groups separately.

Brand-name drugs As Figure 5 indicates, most FDF volume for brands is already produced in the U.S., followed by production in Europe. Although no such data exists for brand API sources, the U.S.-Europe dominance likely persists. Under the current rules, the tariff exposure for a branded drug made in Europe would depend on where the API is manufactured. An FDF drug made in Europe will have the U.S. as the country of origin if the substantial transformation takes place in the U.S. This scenario, probably not common for drugs shipped from Europe, illustrates how consequential country of origin might be for a brand-name drug with a high price point—if the API is made in the U.S., the tariff is zero, but if the API is made in Europe, and a 25% tariff applies, a $10K drug would owe a $2,500 tariff. A drug finished in the U.S. will not pay tariffs on its final product, but it may still be exposed to tariffs on its ingredients. For a branded drug, the cost of goods sold is very low relative to the price so there would not be much price pressure from input cost changes on the product’s final price. What might change, however, is how firms use internal transfer prices for API. Firms use transfer pricing to minimize their tax burden and may transfer API that costs them $100 to produce at close to final finished price. A tariff on API would change that equation, putting downward pressure on the transfer price of API. If the $10K drug is faced with a $2,500 tariff, how much will its U.S. price rise? It depends. One factor influencing the level and form of tariff passthrough is the competitive landscape faced by the affected drug product. Although a monopoly on a molecule-level, a drug may face competition from other branded drug molecules treating the same condition. For example, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy directly competes with Eli Lilly’s Zepbound. If most of Wegovy’s volume were subject to tariffs but the majority of Zepbound’s volume were not, then Novo would find it challenging to increase the effective Wegovy price to payers. If both molecules have high tariff exposures, we could expect the impact to be through lowered rebates, not higher list prices. That is partly driven by Medicaid and Medicare inflation rebates, which manufacturers must pay if prices of their products rise faster than the consumer price index (CPI). Those rebates limit their passthrough through list prices. In a scenario where a brand faces little competition, rebates are low so increasing list prices is the only way to pass through the tariff. Here, again, inflation rebates would limit passthrough beyond the CPI. Manufacturers would also be limited in their passthrough in the commercial market, albeit indirectly. A large swath of purchasers (entities such as certain types of hospitals, clinics, and affiliated retail pharmacies) are eligible for the so-called 340B program, which allows qualifying entities to obtain drugs at a discount pegged to the Medicaid inflation rebate. This means that every unit used by a commercial patient in a 340B entity will be subject to 340B rebates. Political considerations may also dampen tariff passthrough. Experience from the Clinton era health care reform shows that political considerations can limit manufacturers’ willingness to increase prices. And currently there is a lot at stake for branded manufacturers who are interested in changes to Medicare drug negotiation and the 340B program.

Generic injectable drugs sold to hospitals and clinics As Figure 3 indicates, 42% of FDF production for generic sterile injectables is already done in the U.S. These products would not face tariffs on their FDF, although they would face input cost increases if sourcing from abroad—quite likely given the small generic API footprint in the U.S. (Figure 4). With low margins and a high share of API in its cost of goods sold, a tariff on API will likely put upward price pressure. Currently, at least 15% of generic injectable volume is facing tariffs—the 13% coming from China and more than 3% coming from Canada. But China represents a much higher share of API facilities than FDF facilities (Figure 4), suggesting that more products may currently be exposed to tariffs. For instance, it is often noted that China has a hold on API production of antibiotics. Across the three market segments, GSIs face the greatest challenge in their ability to pass on price increases. One reason is immediate—group purchasing organization (GPO) contracts. All hospitals use GPOs to contract for sterile injectable generics used in inpatient settings, with those contracts locking in prices but not quantity. Hospitals not part of the 340B program also use GPO contracts to secure prices of generic injectables used in the outpatient setting. Those contracts generally last one to three years and may limit price increases, unless courts consider tariffs as falling under force majeure—a standard provision in contracts that frees parties from contractual obligations because of an extraordinary event that prevents one or both parties from fulfilling contractual obligations. Even if GPO contracts could be sidestepped, certain generic injectables would face another obstacle—Medicaid inflation rebates and the 340B program. The Medicaid program exposure for generic injectables is unclear, but the resulting 340B exposure can be significant, especially generic chemotherapy agents and so-called supportive drugs designed to protect the body from chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Solid oral dose generics As Figure 3 shows, almost 80% of all the generic drug tablets and capsules we consume in the U.S. come from abroad. Given the small API facility footprint in the U.S. (Figure 4), it is unlikely that many or any of the imported products use U.S.-based API. The unit share of products from China, Canada, and Mexico, around 3.5%, 2.5%, and close to zero, underestimates the exposure of existing tariffs. One reason is that China has a greater representation in API than with FDF. India imports about a third of API by volume, with around 75% of it from China. For a given drug, the upward price pressure of current and potential tariffs will depend on the market share of the versions with tariffs and the capacity of non-exposed manufacturers to take on that volume. For this reason, even what appear limited share of Canadian products might matter. For example, if Teva’s Canadian-made amoxicillin has a large market share, buyers may not have less expensive options to turn to and, therefore, tariffs will put upward pressure on prices across all producers. If we see tariffs rolled out to Indian and European generics, the tariff exposure should be high across virtually all oral dose generic markets. Unlike branded drugs and generic injectables, the ability of oral dose generics to pass on price increases to buyers is less constrained, except for markets with high Medicaid exposure, of which amoxicillin is one. In contrast to generic injectable markets, the retail generics market largely operates as a spot market, with few long-term contracts signed. Additionally, generic drugs are exempt from Medicare inflation rebates, unless only one generic is on the market. They also have much less exposure to the 340B program than brands and injectable generics.

Impact on buyers and payers It is worth considering how increases in U.S. drug prices might affect buyers and payers. Retail pharmacies buy generics on what is pretty much a spot market so any increase in prices will show up quickly in their acquisition costs. However, pharmacies are reimbursed based on contracted rates that are either a share of list price or fixed reimbursement rate. The impact will be immediate as prices rise, challenging pharmacy margins at least until contracts are renegotiated. For hospitals and clinics, branded drug costs are passed to payers but there is a lag in reimbursement, e.g., Medicare has a six-month lag for the reimbursement rate to adjust to the average sales prices. For generics, hospitals are protected in the short run through contracts that GPOs negotiate with manufacturers. 340B hospitals are protected in the short run and the long run, but only for price increases above the CPI. Exposure to increased prices varies by payer. As discussed above, Medicaid is protected above CPI, which means less so if the U.S. also experiences higher inflation. Medicare is protected above CPI for brands and single source generics. But any increase in prices up to the CPI will translate into higher government spending on drugs. Commercial plans will have limited protection through the end of the year when its pharmacy contracts and rebate agreements expire. Increases in drug prices would probably be most visible to patients taking branded products because increases in list prices would directly translate into higher out-of-pocket spending for patients in high deductible plans or with high coinsurance rates. Patients taking generics would also notice quickly if they were in high deductible plans, but the impact would be less given the low generic drug price points. The primary impact on patient pocketbooks would be indirect—premiums would likely rise as the payer spending on drugs increases. The impact would depend in large part on whether tariffs are expanded to drugs coming from Europe and India, with it expanding the tariff exposure. It is also worth noting that commercial payers would likely face the greatest upward spending pressure, not only because they do not face the kinds of protections that Medicaid and Medicare have, but also because prescription drugs make up a much more significant share of their medical spending than what is seen in Medicaid and Medicare.

Will tariffs lead to onshoring of pharmaceutical production? To understand how tariffs affect manufacturing location decisions, it is best to use the framework that firms use to make any investment decision: Is the expected net present value (ENVP) greater than ENVP in locating (or maintaining location) in other markets? Tariffs can positively improve relative ENVP if: Firms expect an increase in profits from locating in the U.S.

Firms expect the incentive will last long enough to ensure a positive return on investment

The costs to enter the market are low enough relative to future profits to ensure a positive return on investment

The ENVP of the current position worsens.

Brand-name drugs The discussion of tariffs in the previous section suggests that the economic incentive for onshoring can be significant for a brand-name drug with a high profit margin. If tariffs were to be expanded to Europe, having both API and FDF production there for a given drug would prove costly. Using the example of a $10K drug with $100 API, a 25% tariff on a $10K final price drug would translate into a twenty-six-fold effective API price (from $100 to $2,600). There is also a less direct incentive to onshore—the political value of onshoring. Manufacturers of branded drugs have several key policy priorities: revising the Medicare drug negotiation program, reforming the 340B program, and pharmacy benefit manager reforms. Unlike tariff policy, which could change easily, any changes to Medicare drug negotiation or the 340B program would be long-lasting. And what would it take to onshore? For tariff purposes, perhaps the easiest path to onshoring would either be through a domestic contract manufacturer or purchasing existing infrastructure. We could also see a shift in existing U.S. production lines, to the extent that U.S. manufacturing sites make product not just for the local U.S. market but also for other countries. None of these approaches are costless or immediate—they require technology transfers, which can take a year or more and are limited by the availability of suitable production lines. But they are cheaper and faster than breaking ground on new sites. Building a manufacturing plant can cost upward of a billion dollars. Recently infrastructure expansion includes Eli Lilly’s $23 billion investment into multiple facilities Merck’s $1 billion plant, $4.1 billion Novo Nordisk’s fill-and-finish plan expansion, Johnson & Johnson’s $2 billion biologics facility, FUJIFILM $1.2 billion expansion of a biotechnology site, and Amgen’s $1 billion biotechnology site expansion. Site construction costs may further increase with steel tariffs because industrial construction relies heavily on steel, now subject to 25% tariffs. The same concern applies to manufacturing equipment, which is all stainless steel. There are several factors in determining a location for a new facility. One factor is permits. Conversations with industry executives reveal that building a manufacturing plant from the ground up generally takes three to five years, much of it the local permitting process for utilities, disposal, and other community concerns. What makes local permits challenging is that they can vary dramatically across locations, increasing the risk for potential delays. Another factor in determining location is workforce. Much of recent U.S. pharmaceutical infrastructure investment has been limited to specific localities, primarily North Carolina and Indiana, not only because of low land prices and firms’ experience with local permitting, but a local, educated workforce, developed in partnership between industry and local universities. The jobs that these kinds of plants create differ from older manufacturing jobs. They require a highly skilled and educated workforce—more engineers and scientists than high school graduates.

Generic drugs The cost to construct a manufacturing site is not any different for branded drugs than generic drugs. What matters more is the type of technology the drug is using. The complexity of API facilities will depend on the complexity of molecules involved, whether simple small molecules, complex ones, or biologics. A fill-and-finish facility is the same for brands and generics, no matter how complex the API. There are two main reasons why generic manufacturers have been increasingly investing in India for small molecule API and FDF. One is cost. You can build a facility in India for a fraction of what it costs in the U.S. because of much cheaper land, labor, and parts. You can build a facility much faster because there are far fewer local permits holding up the process. The other reason is a lower opportunity cost—generic drugs have low margins, so the cost of a shutdown due to manufacturing quality or infrastructure problems is less than for a branded drug. But could tariffs change the onshoring calculus the way it changes incentives for branded manufacturers? The short answer is no. To manufacturers of generic drugs, incentives for onshoring production are significantly lower than for manufacturers of branded products. The $10K drug example with $100 API is illustrative here. Whereas the effective increase of API cost was 26 times for a brand (from $100 to $2,600), a generic with the same API cost but a much smaller margin (say 20%) will face an effective API cost increase of 30% (from $100 to $130). The margin upside from locating in the U.S. will be limited for other reasons. First, domestic manufacturers obtain a big share of their inputs from outside the U.S. Even if those inputs had U.S. options, those options would likely be more expensive than the foreign ones, especially on the fine chemicals side. In the meantime, generic manufacturers will keep facing price pressure from the consolidated buyer base, and unless Congress acts, some generic drugs, including those made domestically, will continue to be limited in their ability to pass on legitimate cost increases. The strategies that branded manufacturers could use in the shorter term, like contracting with third parties or making production more local, are much less likely to work for generic manufacturers. For one, U.S. generic drug facilities likely export very little, meaning there is little to be gained from reorganizing which plants make which products. Using data supporting Figures 3 and 6, we calculate that the capacity needs for onshoring generics would be immense, with capacity needs for generic pills 27 times larger than for branded pills. Any available contract manufacturing capacity would likely go to branded products first, given their ability to pay. Given the value of onshoring to brands, generic manufacturers would easily be outbid for any available capacity. Access to capital would also prove a challenge given the price tag involved and the financial situation of many generic firms. A branded company that has been heavily investing in U.S. infrastructure is Eli Lilly, with $37B in profit in 2024. In comparison, Amneal had a $117M loss in 2024, Sandoz made $1M, Hikma made $612M, and Teva lost $1.6B. Given the uncertainty about the duration of tariffs, it is not clear that the long-time horizon necessary for capital investments is favorable for capital-intensive onshoring of what will continue to be low margin products.

Will drug shortages result from tariffs? Drug shortages happen when supply chains cannot absorb shocks to supply or demand. To understand the potential for shortages, we need to understand whether tariffs could contribute to supply disruptions and whether drug markets are sufficiently resilient to absorb any such supply disruptions. As described in the pricing section, prescription drugs face various constraints in their ability to pass on cost increases to its buyers, especially in the hospital setting. In this context, we may see the profitability of drugs, especially sterile injectable generics, to be challenged. A firm facing margin pressure may work to source from a lower cost environment, but in the short term, the firm faces two options: further cut costs or exit the U.S. market. The potential for further cutting costs is concerning because it can adversely affect product quality if cost cutting happens through equipment maintenance, quality of materials, process control, or quality assurance. If problems arise, for example, the product is contaminated with other API, bacteria, or metal shavings (all actual examples), manufacturers may temporarily shut down or slow down production, leading to a potentially dramatic drop in output. But if FDA oversight is concurrently weakened, economic theory and experience suggests we should expect product quality to decrease. Another bad option is to discontinue production of the unprofitable drug. Historically, discontinuations have not been a major driver of shortages, partly because manufacturers have tended to decrease production before exiting, leaving a more vulnerable market but not triggering a shortage. But companies may be less shy about exiting if they can blame tariffs they cannot control. Discontinuations of production by manufacturers with smaller shares can occur in close succession, magnifying the impact on each. Can markets adjust to temporary shutdowns and permanent discontinuations so that shortages do not result? Extensive experience in the generic sterile injectable market suggests that the generic injectable market is particularly slow to adjust to supply shocks. Part is lack of capacity in the short term and lack of fungibility in the production process—cytotoxic drugs cannot be made on antibiotic lines or a drug that comes in vials cannot be put into IV bags. With long time frames to expand production and the lack of incentives to do so for generic sterile injectables, it is clear that—should supply disruptions occur in sterile injectable markets—shortages will follow.

Will tariffs help de-risk drug supply chains from China? De-risking drug supply chains from China is very different than onshoring pharmaceutical production in the U.S. As described above, the exposure of drug supply chains to China is primarily in small molecule drugs through key starting materials and auxiliary materials. Conversations with industry executives suggest that China dominates the fine chemicals industry of which those inputs are part. Exposure of drug supply chains to China diminishes as production shifts from chemicals to drug manufacturing, but both API and FDF footprint have been growing. Much of the exposure to China is indirect because much of the API and FDF production for generics takes place abroad. This means that it is the Indian and European companies that source chemicals from China. The governments of those countries have recognized that exposure and have put forward plans to reduce their dependence on China. Since 2020, India has actively been decreasing its reliance on China, largely through subsidies for infrastructure. The EU’s proposal has not yet been implemented but it intends to use subsidies to strengthen supply chains of select critical medicines, including antibiotics, which are known to have high China exposure. The impact of tariffs on exposure to China depends on how they are structured. China-only tariffs, or for that matter, a substantial wedge between China tariffs and other locations, have a unique impact on drug supply chains—they drive API production away from China to other locations. We might see a lot more friendshoring than reshoring if China-only tariffs are in place because low-cost options would exist. In turn, sector-wide pharmaceutical tariffs could end up being counterproductive to de-risking efforts. One reason is that China exposure is primarily indirect, through other countries, and, therefore, tariffs on U.S. imports have no impact other than on API sourcing. Decreasing reliance on countries actively subsidizing de-risking initiatives means that the de-risking burden would need to shift to the U.S. Decreasing U.S. exposure to inexpensive Chinese fine chemicals would require a much broader strategy, well beyond the reach of pharmaceutical tariffs.

Considering next steps Many observers will raise higher prices as an argument against tariffs. I take a more nuanced approach—we may have to accept higher prices for generic drugs if we want to have resilient supply chains. However, I am worried that without further policy interventions, tariffs will not make supply chains more resilient. In fact, I am worried that the resilience of many supply chains, already weak for drugs like sterile injectable generics, will be significantly challenged. Of course, the scope and level of tariffs will matter for how they affect specific markets in the short and long run. It will also depend on the structure of specific markets, with generic sterile injectable drugs at the most risk of disruption that might lead to shortages. Most importantly, the impact will depend on what other policy actions the administration and Congress might take to buffer the supply chain. This paper is not intended to provide a comprehensive policy proposal for how to supplement the tariffs, but four main themes arise if the administration intends to move forward with across-the-board pharmaceutical tariffs affecting branded and generic drugs alike. First, the administration should add pressure valves to prevent shortages. This is important because generic margins will be threatened, leading manufacturers to pull unprofitable products from the market. A big factor here is the limited ability of manufacturers to pass on tariffs onto buyers. Some of it has to do with private contracts, but it also relates to the congressionally mandated Medicaid inflation rebates on multisource drugs and the spillover they have on sales to 340B entities. Another policy to consider is substantially delaying tariffs on API used by domestic manufacturers, with it improving their profitability. Second, the administration should increase, not decrease, FDA’s capacity to oversee drug manufacturing. One reason is that generic drug margin squeeze may lead manufacturers to cut costs by cutting corners, which, especially if coupled with weakened FDA oversight, could lead to a higher rate of substandard drugs being shipped to American patients. Another reason is that any onshoring of facilities will increase the existing demand for FDA services—services that are critical for assuring that facilities are set up to consistently manufacture products to specification, with that assuring the safety of drugs that American patients take. Third, the administration should directly finance generic drug onshoring, in recognition that tariffs alone will not create a sufficiently strong business case to attract private investment in pharmaceutical infrastructure. Identifying sources of funding for such initiatives can be challenging. However, here, branded drug tariffs will likely generate significant revenue, which could then be used to stimulate onshoring of generics. The fourth point is perhaps the most challenging—de-risking drug supply chains from China will be significantly more challenging, if not counterproductive, without collaboration with India and Europe."

Shane, Robert E. Litan, William A. Galston",,"The Trump administration’s tariff policy appears to have made the leap from protecting domestic production to protecting tech oligarchs. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “We’re going to work with President Trump to push back on governments around the world” seems to be working.

Presidential action memo

On Feb. 21, President Trump issued a memorandum to appropriate agency heads, directing them to develop tariffs and “other responsive actions” in retaliation against “regulations imposed on United States companies by foreign governments that could inhibit the growth or intended operation of United States companies.”

The groundwork for this was laid by Mark Zuckerberg’s interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, where Zuckerberg said “the U.S. government should be defending its companies.” That wish is being fulfilled by the presidential memo entitled, “Defending American Companies and Innovators from Overseas Extortion and Unfair Fines and Penalties.” Big Tech has found its counterattack to the European Union’s (EU) digital competition and content moderation policies.

The memo asserts that “Foreign countries have additionally adopted regulations governing digital services that are more burdensome and restrictive on United States companies than their own domestic companies.” Although it does not name specific nations and regulations, the memo appears to be in response to the EU’s digital initiatives. These statutes apply only to the largest companies deemed to be marketplace “gatekeepers.” Those dominant companies are, however, headed by CEOs who sat in the first row of the Trump inauguration.

Extraterritorial oversight: a double standard?

The presidential instructions strike an outraged tone: “foreign governments have increasingly exerted extraterritorial authority over American companies.” Yet, such “extraterritorial authority” is neither new nor unique. American products sold abroad have always had to comply with local regulations. From drug and medical device approval to food labels such as what can be called champagne, foreign countries govern their own markets—as does the United States.

The Trump administration is no stranger to imposing its regulatory will on foreign products. European automobiles must meet different safety and emission standards. Imported food products must comply with Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration regulations. Foreign digital cloud services must adhere to U.S. national security and data protection laws. These are just a few examples of the United States practicing what the Trump memo derided as “extraterritorial authority.”

Trump administration policies—such as the destruction of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives—have themselves become extraterritorial. For instance, the British pharmaceutical company GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) suspended its DEI activities in the U.K. due to Trump’s executive orders on DEI, citing the need to comply in the company’s largest market. GSK has since removed references to diversity, equity, and inclusion from its website, suspended mentoring groups for women, and paused a program helping lower-income students enter the workforce—all because of President Trump’s executive orders.

Digital sovereignty: protecting domestic industry or Big Tech profits?

The rationale President Trump has used for tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China has been stopping the flow of illegal drugs, protecting domestic production of aluminum and steel, and maintaining the kind of complex scale manufacturing exemplified by the auto industry. But the new “Defending American Companies and Innovators” memo extends tariffs to “digital services,” arguing that when these services enter foreign markets, local regulations “violate American sovereignty.”

The concept of national sovereignty refers to a nation’s right to govern its domestic affairs free of external interference. The Trump memo expands such sovereign claims to Big Tech profits. Through regulation, it asserts, foreign nations are “appropriating revenues that should contribute to our Nation’s well-being, not theirs.”

This represents a fundamental shift in trade policy. Traditionally, the goal of tariff policy is the protection of domestic production by reducing the demand for foreign imports. The Trump memo, in contrast, targets foreign regulatory action not because they reduce consumer demand, but because they increase costs for Big Tech—cutting into their profit margins.

Citizen protection vs. corporate protection

For the last several decades, Big Tech’s lobbying has kept American policymakers from establishing behavioral expectations for digital markets. The result has hurt consumer privacy, constrained marketplace competition, and facilitated lies and misinformation.

In contrast, the EU has passed laws attempting to prioritize consumer rights over corporate rights. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) addresses privacy. The Digital Markets Act (DMA) deals with competition. The Digital Services Act (DSA) establishes standards for content decisions.

These EU rules do not make American digital products less desirable to European consumers. On the contrary, they enhance digital products by making them safer, more private, and more competitive—at no added cost to consumers. Rather than embracing these rules as improvements, Big Tech frames them as an assault on the profit margins that made them wealthy.

Having successfully lobbied the U.S. government to ignore digital marketplace protections for Americans, Big Tech now wants the American government to strong-arm other nations into doing the same. The Trump memo’s expansion of tariff policy, from protection against undercutting domestic production to the protection of corporate profits, represents a dramatic and fundamental alteration of trade policy.

Does the American internet fiefdom redefine trade protections?

A handful of American companies dominate the global digital marketplace. The Trump memo ventures into their internet empire, targeting foreign efforts to do what the U.S. has failed to do—establish behavioral expectations for the digital marketplace.

Europe’s digital regulation does not make American services less desirable. Instead, the suggested Trump tech tariffs go after the efforts of the EU and others to make digital products safer and more competitive.

The EU has said it would respond “swiftly and decisively” should the Trump administration take “unjustified measures” against its digital rules. Tools available include the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which enables the body to deploy a wide array of measures against economic coercion, encompassing trade, investment, or other policy actions.

Mark Zuckerberg has argued that the only way U.S. tech companies like his “can push back on this global trend is with the support of the U.S. government.” Thanks to the proposed Trump tech tariffs, that government—which has already launched a tit-for-tat trade war over traditional hard goods—now invites another potential trade war, this time fought in defense of Silicon Valley’s bottom line."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-are-tariffs-and-why-are-they-rising/,"What are tariffs, and why are they rising?","Adam Looney, Elena Patel, Wendy Edelberg, Maurice Obstfeld, Robert Maxim, Mark Muro, Shriya Methkupally, Jay Shambaugh, Peter M. Shane, Robert E. Litan",,"This piece was first published on July 1, 2024, and has been updated since.

Unlike other taxes, which require the consent of Congress, legislation passed in 1934, 1962, and 1974 gives the executive branch substantial power to raise tariff rates if it serves a national security interest.

Tariffs are taxes that countries impose on imported goods when they cross the border. From the founding of the United States until 1914, when the federal income tax was introduced, tariffs were the main source of revenue to the federal government . After World War II, the U.S. joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) with 22 other countries, which aimed to promote international trade, and began decreasing tariffs. The downward trend in tariff rates continued until 2018, when the Trump administration raised tariffs on several products, especially those imported from China, igniting a trade war. Tariffs on China stopped increasing in January 2020 but have yet to decrease substantially, and remain well above their pre-2018 levels . The Biden administration kept Trump-era tariffs on China in place, and raised them on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells in May 2024. In his first month in office, President Trump imposed a 10% tariff on imports from China , a 25% tariff on all imports of steel and aluminum, and threatened additional tariffs.

Even with the tariffs imposed during the first Trump and Biden administrations, tariff revenues in fiscal year 2024 were about $77 billion, a very small fraction of the $5.27 trillion in total U.S government revenues for that year. The global proliferation of free trade agreements since World War II has substantially lowered tariff rates, and in turn lowered tariff revenue in wealthy countries, though a number of developing countries still rely on tariffs for a substantial proportion of government revenues.

Among the reasons that countries impose tariffs are to protect domestic industries (particularly those vital to national security), to incentivize foreign countries to change their practices, and to raise revenue. The Trump and Biden administrations said they imposed tariffs for the first two reasons.

Who bears the costs of tariffs?

The burden of tariffs can fall on consumers (who may pay higher prices), on importers (who may absorb the cost by reducing their profits and not pass it along to consumers), on exporters (who may absorb the cost and accept lower net prices for their goods), or on some mix of those. Tariffs are often imposed on intermediate goods—goods that are used in the production of things that consumers buy—and this can both erode producers’ profits (unless they find domestic substitutes for those inputs) and raise the prices they charge consumers. Which party bears the heaviest burden depends on the specific market.

A literature review by the Tax Foundation found that U.S. consumers and firms bore the brunt of costs in the recent trade war, with some studies finding partial pass-through (the price increases, but not by as much as the tariff, hurting both importers and consumers), others finding almost complete pass-through (the price increases by the amount of the tariff), and a couple of cases of over-shifting (the price increases by more than the amount of the tariff). They did not find substantial evidence that foreign exporters absorbed the economic burden of the tariffs by lowering prices.

What impact do tariffs have on economic growth?

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says that the effect of tariffs on output can be ambiguous. On the one hand, some consumers end up buying domestic goods instead of imported goods, and tariff revenues make more resources available for private investment by decreasing the national deficit. These factors increase GDP. On the other, the purchasing power of consumers goes down as goods are more expensive, retaliatory tariffs decrease exports, and some businesses delay new investments out of caution. These factors all decrease GDP.

On balance, economists tend to agree that free trade (low tariffs) increases economic growth more than protectionist trade policy (high tariffs). Free trade allows producers with comparative advantage to get their products to the market cheaply and efficiently, and tariffs get in the way. Additionally, while tariffs may protect infant industries, they can also reduce competition, with adverse effects on an economy. In the 20th century, many developing countries put large tariffs on imported goods using a strategy called “import substitution” to give a country’s domestic industries a leg up until they could compete with advanced countries. In practice, those industries often remained underdeveloped, as they never had to compete with better technology.

Today’s advocates of tariffs say that the textbook models don’t resemble reality because China, in particular, heavily subsidizes key industries and gives them an advantage of over American producers—and could put them out of business altogether, giving China a monopoly.

When the U.S. imposes tariffs on other countries, they often retaliate in ways that hurt the U.S. economy. In January 2025, China, for instance, responded to President Trump’s tariffs by imposing tariffs on U.S. exports liquefied natural gas, coal, crude oil, farm equipment, and some automotive goods.

What are the specific sections of the law that empower the president to impose tariffs?

(This is drawn from a summary prepared by the law firm of Skadden Arps and by the Congressional Research Service.)

Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 232(b) allows the president, after an investigation by the Department of Commerce, to impose tariffs or quotas on imports that threaten U.S. national security. In January 2025, President Trump invoked Section 232 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum.

Trade Act of 1974, Section 122 authorizes the president to impose quotas and tariffs of as much as 15% for up to 150 days against countries that have “large and serious” balance-of-payment surpluses with the U.S. This provision has never been invoked.

Trade Act of 1974, Section 201 allows the president to impose tariffs or quotas on imports of a particular product if the U.S. International Trade Commission finds there has been a surge of imports of that product that cause serious injury to the U.S. industry producing that product. For example, President Trump imposed tariffs on washing machines and solar panels in January 2018 under Section 201.

Trade Act of 1974, Section 301 authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to impose tariffs or quotas if it finds that another country has denied the United States its rights under a trade agreement or has engaged in practices that are unjustifiable, unreasonable, or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce. For instance, President Biden in May 2024 increased tariffs on Chinese steel, aluminum, semiconductors, and electric vehicles under Section 301.

The Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) authorize the president to regulate all forms of international commerce and freeze assets in time of war (TWEA and IEEPA) or in response to “unusual or extraordinary” international threats to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States (IEEPA). President Trump threatened to invoke IEEPA in May 2019 to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico unless Mexico stemmed the flow of immigrants, but reached an agreement with Mexico before the tariffs were actually imposed. He also invoked IEEPA in January 2025 when he threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada and imposed them on China. This use of IEEPA could end up in court.

What tariffs did the first Trump administration raise, and why?

The Trump administration argued tariffs were “imposed to encourage China to change [its] unfair practices,” as they were “threatening United States companies, workers, and farmers.” This statement cited a report from the Office of the United States Trade Representative which found that China’s actions “pressure technology transfer from U.S. companies to Chinese entities … deprive U.S. technology owners of the ability to bargain … and support unauthorized intrusions into, and theft from, the computer networks of U.S. companies.” The administration argued in January 2018 that its initial round of tariffs on washing machines was necessary, as increasing imports had hurt American washing machine manufacturers’ financial performance. The tariffs, which made imports more expensive, were supposed to increase domestic purchases of washing machines. Trump’s U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also argued in July of that year that “China [had] been engaging in industrial policy which [had] resulted in the transfer and theft of intellectual property and technology to the detriment of our economy,” prompting punitive tariffs to spur a change in policy. Trump frequently cited China’s business practices as the cause of the trade deficit between the U.S. and China, saying in June 2018 that “the United States [is] at a permanent and unfair disadvantage, which is reflected in our massive $376 billion trade imbalance in goods.”

China responded to the initial round with retaliatory tariffs. This prompted both countries to continue increasing tariffs for the better part of two years. The U.S.-China trade war paused in January 2020, when the U.S. agreed not to impose planned tariffs on China, and China agreed to buy more U.S. exports. By this point, the level of U.S. tariffs on China had increased from under 5% to over 20%.

What did the Biden administration do with tariffs?

The Biden administration did not reduce any of Trump’s tariffs on China, and in May 2024 raised tariffs on steel, aluminum, medical equipment, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells.

Biden’s May 2024 tariff increases followed much of the same logic as Trump’s initial 2018 tariffs, albeit without mention of the U.S. trade deficit with China. In its release, the administration argued that “American workers continue to face unfair competition from China’s non-market overcapacity in steel and aluminum” and “encourage[d] China to eliminate its unfair trade practices.” The Biden administration, like the Trump administration, sees tariffs on China as both a punitive measure that might spur a change in Chinese industrial policy as well a way to protect domestic manufacturers.

Though the Biden administration drew criticism from advocates of free trade in both parties for keeping protectionist trade policy, he also has important constituents who want to keep tariffs in place. At the start of his term, the U.S. steel industry, including its union workers, urged Biden to hold steady. In November 2023, Democratic senators Bob Casey Jr. and Sherrod Brown, both from Rust Belt states with many union workers, wrote a letter to Biden arguing that tariffs on steel and aluminum were still necessary.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai was asked at a June 2024 event at the Atlantic Council where she agrees and differs with Trump’s former USTR Robert Lighthizer. She said they agree the U.S. has to “change [its] approach to trade,” that she and Lighthizer “share a lot of the same diagnoses” on the U.S.-China trade relationship, and that “one of the ways where Bob and I are most different is in rhetoric.” While many economists and some policymakers in the past have emphasized the benefits of trade to American consumers, Tai and Lighthizer emphasize the risks that trade poses to American workers. For more on Tai’s views, see this interview from Vox.com. For more on Lighthizer’s commentary, see this site, or his 2023 book, “No Trade is Free.”"

Most of the discussion around President Donald Trump’s volley of tariff threats this week has centered on their potential impact on consumer prices and inflation. While price increases are a real concern, another impact involves the fact that regional economies (and the local jobs there) are frequently caught in the middle of trade disputes, though not equally. For now, the most significant disruptions to U.S. communities are on pause, given the last-minute suspension of Trump’s proposed tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico. However, with Trump standing by his threat to impose 10% tariffs on imports from China, and China sticking with its threat of counter-tariffs commencing on Monday, the nation may well be heading toward a new reminder of the unfortunate ways local communities can suffer collateral damage from international faceoffs. While the China clash will play out globally and strategically, its potential impacts will be localized and varied, since different regions have different local industry mixes and structures. Which is why it’s worth looking at the local geography of the pending trade war as an example of how national policy can hurt communities and their economies. To explore how this works, this analysis builds on previous Brookings Metro work from 2018 by assessing which places have the most jobs in industries targeted by China’s proposed retaliatory tariffs. While this piece focuses specifically on Chinese retaliation, it also provides a template for assessing the place-specific economic side effects associated with any future trade tensions, such as if Mexico and Canada reimplement their retaliatory tariffs. In the current case, China has announced retaliatory tariffs on a total of 80 different manufactured and energy products that the U.S. exports there. China will place 15% tariffs on a set of energy exports, including coal, natural gas, and petroleum; and 10% tariffs on 72 manufactured products or parts including trucks, motor homes, and agricultural machinery. These 80 products correspond with 14 different six-digit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) industries in the U.S.1

Table 1

All told, these industries account for between 400,000 and 700,000 jobs in the United States.2 The tariff list contrasts with the much broader tariffs China levied in 2018, which affected 40 industries that supported over 2 million U.S. jobs. In comparison, this round of tariffs is significantly more straightforward in nature, creating a shorter product list and more concentrated economic impacts. While it’s not entirely clear why China is not retaliating with the same level of intensity as it did in 2018, it’s possible that seven years of escalating bilateral tariffs and substantial U.S. export restrictions have simply left the Chinese government with fewer levers to pull when it comes to new trade barriers. Looking at how this may play out across the map of U.S. counties with the largest shares of jobs in industries China’s tariffs target reveals which places are most significantly exposed to potential supply chain disruptions. While the median U.S. county has just 0.05% of its jobs in potentially affected industries (and over 80% of all counties have less than 1% of their jobs in affected industries), there are some notable outliers.

Map 1

Similar to the 2018 tariffs, the industrial heartland is again bearing a disproportionate impact from Chinese retaliation. Some of the most intensely affected counties are energy and manufacturing communities in North Dakota, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Alabama, and West Virginia. For instance, Sargent County, N.D. has the highest potential exposure of any county due to its large manufacturing presence, with 59% of its employment in industries potentially affected by the tariffs. Other counties that may be highly affected include Gibson County, Ind. and Noble County, Oklahoma (both of which are manufacturing hubs), and Irion County, Texas, which relies heavily on oil and natural gas, each with more than 30% of their employment in industries potentially affected by the proposed Chinese tariffs.

Map 2

Turning to total employment in affected industries across particular regions, there are significant concentrations of these jobs in major energy-producing places such as Harris County, Texas (33,000 jobs), as well as manufacturing hubs such as Wayne County, Mich. (26,000); Alameda County, Calif. (25,000); Jefferson County, Ky. (13,000); and Elkhart County, Ind. (12,000). In sum, these maps of U.S. exposure to Chinese tariffs reiterate that while trade skirmishes are frequently discussed in terms of geopolitics and consumer prices, they also entail very tangible local impacts on regional industry clusters, supply chains, and jobs. Given how closely this new round of tariffs is associated with Trump’s policies, it also bears discussing how Chinese retaliation may affect communities where a majority of voters supported him compared to communities that supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

Figure 1

The four largest counties with industries that Chinese tariffs could impact all voted for Harris, led by Harris County, Texas, which is centered on Houston and its substantial oil and gas industry. However, while several large, Harris-voting counties stand to be affected, on balance nearly two-thirds of all jobs in affected industries reside in Trump-voting counties. This again stands in contrast to China’s 2018 tariffs, when employment in affected industries was more evenly divided between Trump-voting counties and counties that voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. While it’s impossible to fully say how much political motivation played a role in this new set of retaliatory tariffs, it’s clear that Trump-voting counties will feel a bigger burden than Harris-voting counties this time around. Many of the most tariff-exposed counties are found in the industrial heartland and Southeast regions, which formed Trump’s electoral base in 2024, including Elkhart and Gibson counties in Indiana; Macomb County, Mich.; Irion County, Texas; and Spartanburg County, S.C. And because the vast majority of counties overall voted for Trump, a significantly larger number of Trump-voting counties have employment in tariff-affected industries than those that voted for Harris. Of the 2,010 counties with employment in tariff-affected industries, 1,722 of them voted for Trump compared to just 288 for Harris. So, while Democratic representatives in Illinois may have constituents affected by the manufacturing tariffs, the burden of Chinese retaliation as a whole is more likely to land on places that voted for Trump and his Republican allies in Congress. Notably, all 71 counties with 10% or more of their jobs in industries exposed to tariffs voted for Trump in 2024. Combined with previous Brookings Metro work showing that Trump-voting counties account for a smaller share of gross domestic product due to their rural nature, this draws attention to smaller communities that are dependent on key tariff-affected industries, and their special sensitivity to disruptions in global trade flows. All in all, it bears noting that the proposed tariffs are the latest in a long string of protectionist actions across the Trump and Biden administrations that have forced supply chains to shift and relocate. And while previous rounds of tariffs and U.S. export controls may have left China with fewer options to retaliate than it had seven years ago, these latest trade actions might nonetheless still cause disruptions for U.S. firms, workers, and communities. As this analysis shows, tariffs—both those implemented by the U.S. as well as foreign retaliation—have real effects on employment in places across the nation, and a continued expansion of protectionism and retaliation is likely to cause substantially more disruption for more American workers."

Shane, Robert E. Litan",,"Sections Toggle section navigation Sections Print

The trading relationship between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada is the most important set of trade relations for all three countries. Canada and Mexico are the United States’ first and second largest export markets with goods exports of $680 billion in 2023, and the U.S. is the largest export market for Canada and Mexico. Exports among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada support over 17 million jobs. The trading relationship among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico is underpinned by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a new trade agreement that replaced NAFTA and was negotiated and finalized during the first Trump administration. Yet, on February 1, 2025, President Trump imposed 25% tariffs (which were subsequently delayed by one month) on imports from Canada and Mexico and 10% tariffs on energy imports from Canada to address flows of fentanyl and illegal migration. Mexico and Canada have indicated they are preparing retaliatory tariffs, and Trump has stated that he will raise U.S. tariffs further in response. The difference in the negative economic impact from the current 10% tariff on energy imports versus a 25% tariff is relatively small. And given that Canada and Mexico look almost certain to retaliate, likely leading to even higher U.S. tariffs, the following assesses the impact of across-the-board 25% tariffs. The impact of these tariffs on trade across North America will be particularly impactful, not only because of the large volume of trade that is involved, but also because of the importance of supply chains, which comprise around 50% of intraregional trade. For example, in the production of a Chevy Silverado or Dodge Challenger, components cross borders multiple times before being assembled into a final product. As a result, imposing a 25% tariff every time a product crosses borders adds up quickly. The following presents the results of simulations based on the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model under two scenarios. The first scenario assesses the economic impacts on the U.S., Mexico, and Canada with the U.S. imposing across-the-board 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada with no retaliation from Canada or Mexico. The second scenario assesses the impact of Canada and Mexico retaliating with 25% tariffs on U.S. imports. All economic impacts are estimated to occur over the medium term (i.e., over the next three to five years). Given that U.S. tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada under USMCA are in most cases close to zero now, a 25% tariff will have significant negative economic shocks for the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. In both scenarios, the economic impact is more severe for Mexico and Canada because a much larger share of their trade is with the U.S.—83% of Mexico’s exports and 78% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S., whereas around one-third of U.S. exports are destined for Canada and Mexico. That said, the economic hit to the U.S. is substantial, with some sectors in particular standing to contract significantly. These tariffs will also harm the Trump administration’s goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China. Continuing to make progress here will require greater trade and investment across North America to strengthen and diversify existing supply chains and reduce reliance on China-centered supply chains. The tariffs are directly at odds with deeper economic integration across North America. In fact, China will benefit from a trade war across North America, as it undercuts efforts to reshore supply chains away from China. More broadly, because these tariffs are most likely inconsistent with USMCA, they signal to the world that any international agreement with the U.S. is not worth all that much, raising difficult questions for all U.S. allies and trading partners about the value of trade agreements with the U.S. One result is that countries will start to hedge—creating new options for trade and investment to insure against an unreliable U.S., which will include being more open to expanding trade and investment relations with China. Impact of tariffs on economic growth Figure 1 shows that tariffs would reduce U.S. GDP growth by around 0.25 percentage points, and with retaliation, U.S. GDP growth falls over 0.3 percentage points. With U.S. GDP in 2024 of approximately $23.5 trillion, this amounts to an estimated loss of U.S. economic output over the medium term of around $45 billion from the 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, and this rises to about $75 billion in lost economic output should Canada and Mexico retaliate. As can be seen, losses to economic growth for Canada and Mexico are around 1.15 percentage points from the 25% U.S. tariffs, and this increases to over 3 percentage points should they both impose 25% tariffs on U.S. imports.

Figure 1

Impact of tariffs on jobs and wages The tariffs will take a toll on employment in all three countries. Figure 2 shows the job losses from tariffs. In the U.S., employment will decline by 0.11% from the 25% tariffs on imports and rise to a 0.25% loss of jobs with retaliation. Based on 2024 job data, this is equivalent to over 177,000 job losses from the 25% tariff, rising to over 400,000 job losses in the event Canada and Mexico retaliate. Job losses in Canada and Mexico would be around 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively, and based on 2024 jobs numbers, this would amount to 278,000 Canadian jobs and 1.4 million Mexican jobs. In the event of retaliation, job loses would increase to almost 2.5% and 3.6% of total employment in Canada and Mexico, equivalent to over 510,000 Canadian jobs and 2.2 million Mexican jobs.

Figure 2

Tariffs will also lead to lower wages across the three countries. In the U.S., wages would decline by 0.2%, and by 0.5% in the event of retaliation. In Canada, wages would fall by over 2.6% and in Mexico by over 4.5% in the scenario of no retaliation, and by 4.9% and over 7% in Canada and Mexico following retaliation by both countries. Worth noting here is that the contraction in demand for labor and decline in wages would be distributed evenly across skilled and unskilled labor, but with a slightly higher impact on unskilled labor. Impact of tariffs on exports The impact from tariffs on exports shown in Figure 3 would also be large. U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico would decline by around 6% from a 25% U.S. tariff, and 9% in the case of retaliation. Exports from Canada to the U.S. and Mexico would contract by 9% with a U.S. tariff, and by 19% with retaliatory tariffs. Mexico’s exports would contract by close to 14% and over 25% with retaliatory tariffs.

Figure 3

Impact of tariffs on inflation As seen in Figure 4, tariffs would also have an impact on inflation. The tariffs would cause inflation to rise in the U.S. by over 1.3 percentage points. With retaliation, the inflation increase in the U.S. would be less at around 0.8 percentage points, but still significant, reflecting the greater slowdown in U.S. economic growth. In the case of Canada, inflation would decline as U.S. tariffs lower economic growth, but should Canada then impose 25% tariffs, inflation would increase, reflecting the impact on the price of imports from the U.S. In the case of Mexico, there is also significant decline in inflation of 9% following U.S. tariffs, reflecting the impact of lower economic growth, and this decline is reduced to around 6 percentage points should Mexico put a 25% tariff on U.S. imports.

Figure 4

Sectoral impacts of tariffs The results presented earlier show the impact on the aggregate economies. The negative impact on exports is widely dispersed across sectors, the bottom line being that all three countries experience significant sector-wide contractions in exports. The following presents some of the sector-specific trade results. Given that there are no tariffs proposed between Canada and Mexico, and as the vast majority of their exports are to the U.S., the following analysis focuses on the impacts on U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico, and the impacts on Canadian and Mexican exports to the U.S. To start, the trinational integration of many of the sectors through supply chains means that many of the sectors affected by these tariffs are common across the three countries. Moreover, many of the sectors affected produce manufacturing and other business inputs, such as metals, computers, and machinery equipment. Raising the costs of these exports will therefore increase costs for businesses in all countries, reducing their competitiveness, and lead many businesses to instead source inputs from other countries, including those in Asia. In the U.S. for example, as shown in Table 1, exports across mining, manufacturing, lumber, and metals would all suffer large contractions in exports. U.S. mining exports to Canada suffer an almost 60% decline in exports, and following retaliation, U.S. mining exports are almost completely wiped out, with a 97% contraction. There is a 25% contraction in U.S. motor vehicle exports to Canada that increases to 55% with retaliation, and products in “other transport” fall by 18% following U.S. tariffs and by 79% with retaliation. In the electrical equipment sector, the 12% decline in exports from the electrical sector will turn into a 30% plus decline with retaliation.

Table 1

Table 2 shows that U.S. exports to Mexico also fall across manufacturing, lumber, foods, and metals in particular, but almost every sector experiences a large contraction in exports. For example, U.S. exports of nonferrous metals such as copper, aluminum, zinc, and gold decline by 35% following the U.S. tariffs and then by 78% with retaliation by Mexico. U.S. exports of manufactured products—computers and electronics, motor vehicles, electronic equipment, other transport—all suffer large declines. For example, there is a 31% decline in exports of computers and electronics, and with retaliation, these U.S. exports fall by over 80%. Exports of motor vehicles also decline by 23% with tariffs and then by 65% following retaliation.

Table 2

Table 3 shows some of the key sectors where Canada’s exports to the U.S. would contract across manufacturing, mining, textiles, rubber, and plastics. For example, exports of electronic equipment and electronics decline by over 70% following U.S. tariffs and by close to 80% with retaliatory tariffs. Exports of “other transport” decline by 70% with tariffs and 74% with retaliation, and motor vehicle exports from Canada decline by 53% with the U.S. tariffs and by 68% with retaliatory tariffs.

Table 3

The decline in exports from Mexico are across mining, the auto sector, electrical equipment, rubber and apparel, and textiles. For instance, Mexico’s mining sector exports suffer contractions of over 90%. The pharmaceutical sector also contracts over 60% with tariffs and over 70% following retaliation. Mexico’s exports of motor vehicle and electronic equipment sectors also contract significantly, a common outcome for all three countries given the supply chains in these sectors, with exports falling 40% and 55%, respectively, and with the retaliation, exports of these products fall by 50% and 62%.

Table 4

Conclusion The U.S. tariff of 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico is going to reduce U.S. economic growth, reduce jobs, cause wages to fall, and prices to rise, and retaliation by Canada and Mexico will multiply the economic harms across the three countries. President Trump has said that these tariffs are in response to flows of fentanyl and illegal immigrants from Mexico and Canada. The problem with these tariffs is that they impose immediate costs on U.S. consumers, workers, and businesses without a clear link between these tariffs and how they will reduce flows of immigrants or fentanyl. Moreover, these tariffs will harm the Trump administration’s goal of developing more secure supply chains and competing with China. More broadly, because these tariffs are most likely inconsistent with USMCA, countries will start to hedge—creating new options for trade and investment to insure against an unreliable U.S., which will include being more open to expanding trade and investment relations with China. Unless the Trump administration resolves its issues with Canada and Mexico and unwinds these tariffs quickly, the economic, diplomatic, and strategic harms from the tariffs will be substantial."

Shane, Robert E. Litan",,"The Vitals

President Trump has advocated for greater trade protectionism and imposed a series of tariffs on China, Mexico, Canada, the European Union, and other trading partners. His administration justified these policies on three grounds: that they would benefit American workers, especially in manufacturing; that they would give the United States leverage to renegotiate trade agreements with other countries; and that they were necessary to protect American national security. Judged by these three metrics, how successful were Trump’s tariffs? And what’s at stake in this election for the future of American trade policy?

American firms and consumers paid the vast majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs.

While tariffs benefited some workers in import-competing industries, they hurt workers in sectors that rely on imported inputs and those in exporting industries facing retaliation from trade partners.

Trump’s tariffs did not help the U.S. negotiate better trade agreements or significantly improve national security.

A closer look

What are tariffs?

Tariffs are taxes paid on imported goods. In earlier eras tariffs were an important source of government revenue, but in recent decades the U.S. government has used tariffs primarily to shield certain industries from foreign competition. Over the years, Congress has delegated substantial authority to impose tariffs to the executive branch, which means presidents have considerable discretion to increase tariffs on specific products or imports from specific countries.

President Trump used this power to increase tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum, as well as on a broad range of products from China. Overall, in 2019, the U.S. government brought in $79 billion in tariffs, twice the value from two years earlier and a sharp break from recent trends.

Who pays for tariffs?

The $79 billion brought in by the Treasury could in principle come from three different sources: the foreign companies exporting goods to the United States; the American companies importing goods from abroad, or using imported inputs in their production processes; and American households as final consumers. Tracking precisely who pays for tariffs is difficult, because it depends on how buyers and sellers adjust their prices in response to tariffs, and how these price changes then ripple though supply chains and down to final consumers. The Trump administration has repeatedly argued that foreign companies are paying for tariffs. But multiple studies suggest this is not the case: the cost of tariffs have been borne almost entirely by American households and American firms, not foreign exporters. While estimates vary, economic analyses suggest the average American household has paid somewhere from several hundred up to a thousand dollars or more per year thanks to higher consumer prices attributable to the tariffs.

Did tariffs benefit American workers?

It depends which workers we’re talking about. Workers who produce the specific goods covered by tariffs typically benefit from the protection. While it is difficult to pin down exact numbers, the tariffs on steel products appear to have helped create several thousand jobs in the steel industry; similarly, tariffs on washing machines are associated with approximately 1,800 new jobs at Whirlpool, Samsung, and LG factories in the US. In these specific industries, then, tariffs have probably been good for workers.

But any benefits for workers in import-competing industries need to be balanced against losses for two other groups of workers. First, many workers are employed in factories that use imported goods as inputs in their production processes, and when these imports increase in cost due to tariffs, it harms their production, often leading to job losses. Second, when the U.S. unilaterally imposes tariffs, American trading partners often implement retaliatory tariffs which may limit U.S. export production, again ultimately harming workers in these industries.

In general, then, Trump’s tariffs have helped some workers and hurt others. Nothing is particularly surprising about this; trade policy almost always has important distributive effects, and any change in trade policy is a choice to benefit some groups at the expense of others. Yet, overall, when economists have attempted to add up the net effect of Trump’s tariffs on jobs, any gains in importing-competing sectors appear to have been more than offset by losses in industries that use imported inputs and face retaliation on their foreign exports. And even those jobs that have been created have come at great cost: studies suggest American consumers paid about $817,000 in higher prices attributable to the tariffs for every job created in the washing machine industry and $900,000 in the steel industry. While policy interventions to support manufacturing jobs may be warranted, there are cheaper ways to do so.

Did tariffs help the US negotiate better trade agreements?

The Trump administration also argued tariffs were part of a tougher negotiating posture that would give the United States leverage to secure more favorable trade agreements. During its first term the administration completed two major trade agreements: the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which updated the previous North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); and the so-called “Phase One” China deal. U.S. tariffs certainly shaped the context for both the USMCA and China negotiations: in the absence of U.S. pressure, including the application of tariffs and threats of future tariffs, it seems unlikely either Mexico and Canada or China would have sought to negotiate a new deal with the Trump administration. In this basic sense, then, Trump’s tariffs did give the U.S. trade negotiators some leverage.

Yet when we look in closer detail at the outcome of these negotiations, the threat of tariffs does not appear to have brought substantial gains to the U.S. The USMCA is, in general, very similar to NAFTA. And the Phase One trade deal consisted mostly of basic purchase agreements—which, due in part to the COVID-19 shutdown, are extremely unlikely to be attained—while punting the trickier, but more important, structural questions to a hypothetical Phase Two deal (which at this point seems unlikely to ever occur). Tariffs may get other countries’ attention, but don’t necessarily lead them to make substantial concessions to U.S. demands.

And while Trump’s tariffs may have brought some countries to the negotiating table, in the long run the tariffs likely also contributed to pushing other potential trade partners away. When negotiating trade agreements, countries want partners whose policies are stable and predictable, with the goal of establishing a long-term, win-win partnership. Trump’s eagerness to resort to tariffs, including in relations with close allies, has made the U.S. a less desirable trade partner for other countries.

Did tariffs improve American national security?

More than any other recent administration, President Trump has cited national security concerns as a justification for protectionist trade policies. His administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on the basis of national security reviews (known as Section 232 investigations), and threatened to do so for automobiles, uranium, and titanium. The administration has framed its China trade policy in national security terms, particularly with respect to technology competition involving companies such as Huawei and TikTok. White House advisor Peter Navarro has argued “economic security is national security,” and sought to explicitly link a more confrontational and assertive international economic policy with a more aggressive military and foreign policy.

Evaluating the impact of trade policy on national security is difficult. Overall, there is a general consensus among Washington policymakers that America’s heightened security competition with China merits revising the economic strategy of the 1990s and 2000s, which was premised primarily on increasing engagement, but less clarity on what changes are needed. The national security case for tariffs on steel and aluminum is even murkier: while there may be a case for ensuring domestic production capacity for these commodities, it isn’t clear tariffs are the best instrument (or that they even achieve this goal). These tariffs antagonized many of America’s closest security partners, particularly Canada, which undermined efforts to cultivate a broader multilateral alliance to challenge China. Moreover, the Trump administration’s frequent recourses to national security on flimsy grounds will make it more difficult for the U.S. to push back when other countries cloak protectionism in tenuous appeals to national security.

What’s at stake in the upcoming election?

If Joe Biden wins, he will likely seek to reverse some of Trump’s more protectionist pushes. In particular, Biden will seek to repair trade relations with allies in North America and Europe, and to work through established channels such as the World Trade Organization (WTO). Yet he appears unlikely to simply return to the trade paradigm of the Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama administrations. Several Democratic trade policy advisors have argued that Biden should break with earlier, more pro-corporate approaches to trade. For example, Biden’s trade policy would likely have greater emphasis on labor and environmental concerns than in previous administrations. Biden has promised his administration “won’t enter into any new trade agreements until we’ve made major investments here at home, in our workers and our communities” and advocated for a strong Buy American procurement policy. He has sharply criticized Trump’s tariffs on China, but it’s not clear if his administration would maintain them or not. Either way, a Biden administration would almost certainly adopt a more confrontational trade policy with China than Clinton, Bush, and Obama did.

For his part, if Trump wins a second term, we should not necessarily expect just a continuation of his first-term trade policies. While Trump himself has long had protectionist impulses, during his first term his team of advisors was divided between a more establishment, pro-trade group and a more protectionist faction. One result was that, particularly through the early years of his presidency, Trump’s trade rhetoric far outpaced actual changes to policy—Trump’s most aggressive proclamations never came to pass, and when the administration did renegotiate trade deals (such as NAFTA), the changes were quite modest. Over the course of the last three and a half years, however, many of the advisors and officials who restrained Trump’s protectionism have left office, tilting the balance in favor of bolder, more radical policy options. This dynamic would likely extend during a second term, which suggests the Trump administration might be more likely to follow through on some of his more extreme ideas. These include withdrawing from the WTO (though to be sure, this idea would still face strong resistance) and provoking further trade fights with allies such as Europe, Canada, Mexico, and Japan. In a second term, the guardrails that kept Trump’s trade policies from deviating too far from established approaches would further erode, opening the door to more radical changes."

Shane, Robert E. Litan",,"To be clear, we—like most economists—have a dim view of unilateral tariffs. Tariffs increase the cost of consumption for domestic consumers, and they inefficiently shift economic activity towards sectors where production is more expensive. Moreover, tariffs often provoke retaliation from our trading partners and escalate into trade wars. Putting the economic issues aside, the proposed tariffs by the president-elect raise procedural and institutional questions about whether and how the executive branch should have the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, and how quickly it can act.

The executive branch has an unusually broad menu of options when it comes to tariffs—the president is able to dictate tariff rates, which countries and goods they apply to, and when and how to impose them without Congressional approval and sometimes without public input or judicial review. We can’t think of another economic policy issue where the executive has so much power and escapes the checks and balances that apply elsewhere to executive branch actions. This is a choice made by the U.S. Congress.

President-elect Trump has suggested that he will impose a wide-range of tariffs when he takes office, including a blanket tariff of 10–20% on all imported goods, an additional tariff between 60 and 100% on Chinese goods, a 100% tariff on countries within the BRICS alliance if they attempt to undermine the U.S. dollar’s status as a global reserve currency, and a 25% tariff on all products imported from Mexico and Canada . Notably, he wants to impose at least some of these tariffs on day one. Can he impose tariffs that quickly? Potentially, yes.

The power to impose taxes, including tariffs, unequivocally resides with Congress according to the U.S. Constitution. This authority is essential for funding government operations, such as national defense, public services, and infrastructure. The development of tax legislation—jointly managed by the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees—is a process that ideally includes careful study and public debate and can take months or even years. This means that the legislative process cannot realistically impose new taxes on day one of a new administration.

Tariffs are unusual in that they are a tax that is not implemented by congressional legislation, and thus circumvent a potentially lengthy and deliberative journey through the House and Senate. Instead, tariffs are imposed by executive branch regulation—but unlike most federal regulations, tariffs avoid almost all the legislated guardrails, administrative procedures, and judicial reviews that apply to other executive regulations. This means implementing new tariffs can proceed much more quickly than other significant regulatory actions implemented by the executive branch. How fast depends on which authority Trump chooses to invoke.

The executive branch has the authority to impose tariffs through two different processes. First, a series of Trade Acts—enacted between the 1930s and 1970s—empower the executive branch to proclaim tariff rates to protect American workers and consumers from unfair trade practices. This is the authority that empowered President Trump to impose limited tariffs on products like solar panels and washing machines during his first administration. To invoke this authority, an investigation is initiated by either the Department of Commerce or the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether tariffs are necessary to remedy unfair trade practices. These investigations take some minimal time—including a 30-60 day notice-and-comment period that allows the public an opportunity to raise concerns—meaning that these authorities cannot realistically be used to impose new tariffs on trading partners on day one.

Instead, if President Trump wishes to impose tariffs more quickly, he will likely need to invoke the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Under the IEEA, Congress grants authority to the executive branch to address “unusual and extraordinary” peacetime threats to national security, foreign policy, or the economy. In May, 2019, President Trump threatened to use the IEEPA to implement escalating tariffs on Mexican imports in May 2019. He withdrew this threat after Mexico committed to specific measures aimed at curbing immigration.

Unlike tariffs enacted under the various trade acts, those imposed under the IEEPA bypass departmental reports, reviews, and public notice-and-comment periods. This streamlines implementation but bypasses essentially all regulatory checks and balances. The IEEPA’s speed makes it a likely tool for imposing new tariffs on day one. However, this path also raises legal questions, as seen in 2019, when skepticism emerged over its appropriateness for tariffs on Mexican imports. These criticisms are likely to resurface if the IEEPA is again invoked to justify now-broader tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports.

To restore the balance of power, Congress could consider reforms to restore oversight and accountability in trade policy. In a new research brief, we trace the evolution of executive authority in determining tariff rates, highlighting how this authority bypasses the rigorous process that is already in place to provide a check on executive authority to impose other regulations, and we outline what options are on the table to restore oversight. While several bipartisan legislative efforts to address this imbalance have surfaced, they have gained little traction. Without meaningful reform, unchecked tariff authority has the potential to destabilize economic and diplomatic relationships. As the threat of sweeping, unilateral tariffs looms, the need for a more balanced and accountable system has never been more urgent."

Back to top Introduction

On April 2, 2025, President Donald Trump declared that foreign trade and economic practices had created a “national emergency.” Large and persistent annual U.S. trade deficits, he said, had “hollowed out our manufacturing base,” discouraged the creation of “advanced domestic manufacturing,” undermined “critical supply chains,” and rendered the U.S. defense industrial base “dependent on foreign adversaries.” To meet this emergency, he invoked his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to impose a 10% tariff on all countries and an individualized higher tariff on countries with which the United States has the largest trade deficits in goods. Does IEEPA provide an adequate legal basis for the president’s actions, which have affected the United States’ economic and diplomatic relations with nearly every country on earth? The federal judiciary is now addressing this question. A challenge to Trump’s executive order from U.S. firms and jurisdictions has moved quickly through the courts. On Sept. 9, the Supreme Court not only agreed to hear the case but also put it on a fast track. The government must file its brief by Sept. 19, challengers must reply by Oct. 20, and the Court will hear oral arguments during the first week of November. The Court may hand down its decision, which could undermine the centerpiece of the president’s economic agenda, by year’s end.

Back to top The historical background of IEEPA

As the United States entered World War I, Congress passed the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) in 1917. This statute gave the executive “an extraordinary degree of control over international trade, investment, migration, and communications between the United States and its enemies.”1 Over the next six decades, presidents steadily expanded their interpretation and use of TWEA. Early in his first term, President Roosevelt invoked it as the basis for declaring his Bank Holiday. Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson used it to deal with a wide range of trade, investment, and currency issues. President Nixon invoked it to declare a state of emergency and impose a 10% supplemental tariff on all goods entering the United States, an action that figures centrally in the current debate about President Trump’s policies. In the wake of Vietnam, Watergate, and revelations of domestic spying, Congress became increasingly concerned about the expansion of executive power and sought to rein it in, in part by reevaluating its grants of emergency power to the president. Among other statutes, TWEA was criticized for the open-ended authority it gave the chief executive. Specifically, a House report on the reform of emergency legislation charged that TWEA required no consultation with Congress, set no time limits on a state of emergency, provided no mechanism for congressional review, gave Congress no way of terminating it, imposed no effective limits on the scope of economic powers the president could use, and failed to require a relationship between the nature of the emergency the president declared and the actions he took pursuant to this declaration. To correct what it saw as these deficiencies, Congress proceeded in two steps. First, in 1976, it enacted the National Emergencies Act (NEA), an umbrella act covering all emergencies. It imposed new reporting requirements on the president, created mechanisms for the termination of emergencies, and provided for the termination of all existing emergencies, except those imposed pursuant to TWEA. Second, to address TWEA, which raised complex issues of monetary and foreign policy, Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977 to limit the authorities the president could invoke and subject the president to a range of procedural limitations, including those imposed by the NEA. In an important move, the report of the House Committee on International Relations, a detailed document that undergirded this reform effort, declared that “emergencies are by their nature rare and brief, and are not to be equated with normal ongoing problems,” adding that “A national emergency should be declared and emergency authorities employed only with respect to a specific set of circumstances which constitute a real emergency, and for no other purpose.”2 To put this in medical terms, the House sought to distinguish between the ailments that lead patients to consult their internist and the unusual, sometimes life-threatening events that make them rush to the ER. IEEPA was designed for the latter, not the former. Consistent with the language of the House report, the text of the Act states that the presidential authorities it creates “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared.”3

Back to top Events since the enactment of IEEPA

Many analysts believe that IEEPA has failed to achieve one of its most fundamental objectives—limiting executive power.4 Not only have the justifications for invoking the statute become less geographically specific, but also the stated rationales have become broader in both length and subject matter. Far from being “rare and brief,” as the House intended, IEEPA-based emergency declarations have become numerous and long-lasting. Presidents have invoked IEEPA more than 70 times; on average, these emergencies last for nearly nine years, and many remain in place for decades. The mechanism for terminating emergencies has failed, in part for reasons that the drafters of IEEPA could not have anticipated. The bill provided that Congress could end an emergency by passing a “concurrent resolution” to this effect in both the House and Senate. This meant that a simple majority in both chambers would suffice, and the president would have no say in the matter. But just six years after the passage of IEEPA, in the case of INS v. Chadha (1983)5, the Supreme Court ruled that this device, known as the “legislative veto,” was unconstitutional. In response, Congress revised a number of statutes, including those dealing with economic emergencies, to require concurrence from both Houses, subjecting this “joint” resolution to a presidential signature or veto.6 If the president rejected the resolution, it would then require a two-thirds majority in both congressional chambers to override his veto and put the resolution into effect—a threshold that is especially hard to clear in an era of heightened partisan polarization and narrow legislative majorities. It is not surprising that Congress has never been able to terminate an emergency declaration based on IEEPA.7 For all practical purposes, then, the president gets his way on this matter—unless the judiciary intervenes.

Back to top Recent developments

This brings us to the current controversy sparked by President Trump’s invocation of IEEPA as the basis for his new tariff regime. In response, companies claiming harm resulting from the president’s action filed suit alleging that he had exceeded his legal authority under IEEPA. On May 28, 2025, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT) ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The question, the court stated, is whether IEEPA gives the president the authority to “impose unlimited tariffs on goods from nearly every country in the world.” The answer was that it did not, and the court set aside all the tariffs President Trump had imposed under the authority of this Act.8 In finding for the plaintiffs, the Court of International Trade took note of the fact that in U.S. v. Yoshida (1975), the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals had upheld President Nixon’s authority under TWEA to impose a 10% tariff to counter a balance of payments crisis.9 Because IEEPA had repeated, verbatim, the relevant portion of TWEA, the Trump administration’s lawyers argued that this 50-year-old case was relevant to, and justified, the president’s action.10 The Court of International Trade disagreed, citing the court’s language in Yoshida: “The declaration of a national emergency is not a talisman enabling the President to rewrite the tariff schedules.” The Yoshida court had upheld President Nixon’s tariffs on the basis that they were limited in both extent and duration, “which is quite different from imposing whatever tariff rates he deems desirable.”11 Similarly, the Court of International Trade declined to read the president’s power under IEEPA to “regulate . . . importation” as authorizing the president to “impose whatever tariff rates he deems desirable.” This is not only an issue of statutory interpretation, said the Court. Reading the statute to give the president unlimited discretion over tariff rates “would create an unconstitutional delegation of power.” Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs. While Congress may delegate a portion of this power by allowing the president to execute it, it cannot give away this power altogether without breaching constitutional limits. After all, as James Madison wrote in Federalist 48, “the powers properly belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly and completely administered by either of the other departments.” (My emphasis.)12 The Court also cited, and endorsed, the plaintiffs’ use of another, much more recent principle: The Supreme Court’s “major questions” doctrine, which states that when Congress delegates powers of “vast economic and political significance,” it must “speak clearly.”13 Regarding tariffs, Congress had not done so. Indeed, the long list of presidential powers in IEEPA did not include the words “tariffs” or “duties.” The Trump administration appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which opted to hear it before an en banc panel of all of its active judges in lieu of the normal three-judge panel. During oral argument on July 31, Justice Department lawyer Brett Shumate argued that IEEPA is written broadly, and the power to impose tariffs is included under the power the Act grants the president to “regulate” imports. But as one analysis put it, the judges on the federal appeals court weren’t buying it. “Why would we read tariffs into that statute?” one judge asked. “Is the plain meaning of ‘regulate’ to impose tariffs?” another inquired. As for the administration’s use of the Nixon-era case to justify a broad and open-ended tariff regime, one judge told Mr. Shumate, “[Y]ou are just discarding portions of Yoshida that you don’t like.”14 On Aug. 29, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit handed down its decision reviewing the holding of the CIT. By a majority of 7-4, the appeals court upheld the core of the CIT decision: In imposing his sweeping program of global tariffs, President Trump had exceeded the authority granted to him under IEEPA. Because the majority decision, the concurring opinion, and the dissent offer a roadmap to the arguments the Supreme Court will eventually hear, I lay them out at some length. In its majority decision, the appeals court noted that the enumeration of powers delegated to the president did not “explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.” Many statutes do give the president the power to impose tariffs, and in each case, Congress has used “clear and precise terms” to do so. Accordingly, the appeals court rejected the government’s assertion that the president’s power under IEEPA to “regulate” implied the power to impose tariffs, and it provided examples where Congress had granted to the executive branch the power to regulate without delegating the power to impose tariffs.15 In addition to arguments based on the language of the statute, the majority invoked the Supreme Court’s “major questions” test to reject the government’s claims. This test becomes relevant whenever the government infers from statutory language an authority, not explicitly granted, that entails vast “economic and political significance.” In recent years, the Supreme Court has deployed this doctrine to restrict the executive branch’s authority in areas such as the EPA’s environmental regulation and President Biden’s effort to forgive student loans. Notably, the Court pointed out, no previous administration had located in IEEPA the power to impose sweeping tariffs. A key reason: “Tariffs are a core Congressional power” that the legislative branch is unlikely to delegate without explicitly declaring its intent to do so.16 Finally, citing a number of Supreme Court decisions, the appeals court rejected the government’s argument that it is inappropriate to construe congressional delegations of power to the executive in the arena of foreign affairs and national security. Whatever the issue, the executive is not free from congressional checks and balances just because foreign affairs are at issue. The power to tax is just as central to Congress as is the president’s lead role in foreign policy and defense.17 The appeals court might have used these arguments to conclude that its reading of IEEPA excluded the imposition of any and all tariffs, citing IEEPA as the legal basis. In a concurring opinion, four members of the majority were prepared to take this step.18 The majority opinion did not. Instead, it interpreted IEEPA in light of the Yoshida decision, which ratified the Nixon administration’s imposition of a temporary 10% duty on imports but stated explicitly that an unlimited tariff authority would not be permitted under the terms of the existing statute, the language of which was incorporated into IEEPA.19 Because Trump’s tariffs are “unbounded in scope, amount, and duration,” they exceed the authority granted to the chief executive under IEEPA. The dissent mostly accepted the majority’s framing of the controversy as a matter of statutory interpretation but argued that the “natural reading of ‘regulate’ in the phrase ‘regulate . . . importation’ is one that embraces tariffs.”20 More broadly, the dissenters insisted, “We know of no persuasive basis for thinking that Congress wanted to deny the President use of the tariffing tool, a common regulatory tool, to address the threats covered by IEEPA.”21 And contrary to the majority, the dissenters argued that statutes covering the president’s authority in foreign affairs should be broadly rather than strictly construed.22 The dissenters also rejected the majority’s strategy of reading the limits imposed by Yoshida into the interpretation of IEEPA. “We see no sound basis,” they stated, for insisting that “limits in non-emergency tariff authorizations be read into emergency authorizations.”23 And finally, they rejected the application of the major questions doctrine to IEEPA. In a direct appeal to a potentially pivotal justice, they cite Brett Kavanaugh as distinguishing between domestic issues and foreign policy on the ground that Congress usually intends to give the president substantial authority to protect the country and the American people.24 Notably, neither the appeals court’s majority nor the dissenters paid any attention to the argument, advanced by the president and his supporters, that ruling against the president’s global tariff regime would be unacceptably disruptive. The America First Policy Institute warns that a ruling against the president would “eviscerate” his foreign policy and “deprive America of hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.” President Trump himself has written on Truth Social that “If our Country was not able to protect itself by using TARIFFS AGAINST TARIFFS, WE WOULD BE ‘DEAD,’ WITH NO CHANCE OF SURVIVAL OR SUCCESS.”25 To state the obvious, these are policy and political claims that do not address the core legal issue of whether the president has the authority to impose these tariffs.

Back to top Conclusion

President Trump refers to the legal contest sparked by his tariffs as “America’s big case.”26 This is not an overstatement. At stake is not only the linchpin of the president’s economic agenda but also the trajectory of executive power in a period that has witnessed its steady and now accelerating expansion. When this case reaches the Supreme Court, its conservative majority will face the task of balancing its broad support for a strong executive against the breathtaking scope of the powers the president is now asserting. Although the case pivots on questions of statutory interpretation rather than constitutional issues, nothing less than the constitutional balance among the three branches of government is on the line. However the Court rules, its decision will reverberate for years, even decades, to come."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Brookings Institution,https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-chinas-tariffs-could-affect-u-s-workers-and-industries/,How China’s proposed tariffs could affect U.S. workers and industries,"Max Bouchet, Joseph Parilla, Selma Ashipala-Musavyi, Landry Signé, Robert Maxim, Allison Neswood, Robert Puentes, Mark Muro, Gordon Hanson",,"This piece was updated on April 20, 2018 to reflect the fact that the 128 products listed for Chinese tariffs in retaliation to American steel and aluminum tariffs went into effect on April 2. The others remain proposed.

The Trump administration’s tit-for-tat with Beijing over potential tariffs has captivated global audiences. Trade experts, diplomats, and news organizations are all fulminating about the high-level performance art being played out by the world’s two largest economies. Gigantic, distant agendas are taking shape.

Yet for all that is remote and portentous about the standoff, China’s lightning-bolt announcements last week with two lists of tariffs on hundreds of American goods—responding to and then precipitating new threats from the Trump administration—had the ancillary effect of bringing the far-away global down to the local.

Trade diplomacy can often seem an international and faraway activity. However, when it comes down to specific lists of tariffs on particular products that Americans produce, from ginseng to airplanes, the high-level posturing of Washington and Beijing suddenly gets more real.

To observe the local effects, therefore, we analyzed the exposure of U.S. industries and places to potential disruption from the two rounds of threatened Chinese tariffs. To do this, we first created a list of the 40 U.S. industries that produce both the 128 products listed by China for tariffs in retaliation to both general U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs, which are now in effect, as well as the 106 products listed for potential retaliation over proposed American tariffs on some 1,300 Chinese goods. We then checked their national and county-by-county employment as a way of gauging industry and local vulnerability to potential trade gyrations. In this fashion, we’ve sketched a granular, bottom-up look at industries’ and locations’ exposure to Chinese saber-rattling, which in turn provides a revealing look at the geography of U.S. production.

What do our tables and maps show? Our top line estimates suggest while the total number of jobs potentially disrupted by an all-out trade war remains modest, the count encompasses a diverse and shrewdly chosen “hit list” of hallmark American industries—one that appears well-calculated to scare both red and blue America.

Altogether, we count some 2.1 million jobs in the 40 industries that produce products now slated for Chinese retaliation, and see a wide variation in the type and number of exposed jobs in those industries. Here’s a look at the industry list:

Scan the list and it ranges from sizable industrial enterprises such as plastics manufacturing, aircraft manufacturing, and automotive/light/truck/motor home production (300,000, 230,000, and 200,000 direct jobs respectively, in 2016); to farm-sector mainstays like corn (18,000 jobs), soybeans (5,000 positions), and hog production and slaughter (147,000 workers); and into specialty industries such as fruit and nut production (187,000 workers), wineries (60,000 workers), and distilleries (12,000 positions).

Overall, the list suggests that Chinese trade bureaucrats have as good, or perhaps even better, of a feel for the diverse and culturally significant key elements that comprise the U.S. production base than their U.S. counterparts. High-tech and low-tech, industrial and agricultural, commodity and specialty production are all represented and put into play.

Map the potentially affected jobs, meanwhile, and it’s very clear that the Chinese have done their homework about the geography of both the U.S. production system and its divided politics.

To confirm this, we mapped the county-by-county location of employment in the 40 potentially affected industries (as a share of the local total); here are the results:

Right off, you can see that the local map of exposure amounts to a bird’s-eye view of how diverse and widely distributed is the American production system.

Immediately the classic heartland manufacturing base jumps out, anchored by auto, SUV, and RV assembly plants in the Midwest and upper South along Interstate 65. Likewise, the familiar Midwestern agricultural complex is visible, with counties dedicated to corn and soybeans, and led by the highly visible rural counties in the Midwest and South that are dominated by slaughter houses.

And yet, the shaded areas of tariff exposure extend way beyond the usual factory and commodity agriculture domain into other realms. Far from the Midwestern factory belt, California is heavily affected, with Napa Valley wines; Central Valley vegetables, fruit, and berry growers; and Los Angeles plastics all potentially impacted. Similarly, rural fruit- and nut-growing counties of the Northwest stand out as exposed as does Snohomish County, Wash., with its 38,000 aircraft manufacturing jobs mostly at Boeing. Also informative is the importance of urban and suburban places, such as Marion County in central Indiana and Montgomery County near Philadelphia, that are involved in the sizable pharmaceutical manufacturing industry.

Indeed, a look at a new map focused on concentrations of potentially affected employment underscores the urban and Far Western cast of worker exposure to potential future China gyrations:

Less far flung than the map of local shares, the map of absolute totals especially highlights a mix of big-city metro export hubs that were discussed here as well as the heavy China trade of the Pacific Coast states, anchored by aircraft, pharma, fruit, and vegetables production.

As to what these patterns say about the current trade skirmishing, a few points are relevant. For one thing, as several of us have said before about trade reliance more generally, the map of U.S. tariff exposure makes clear that while any “trade war” may be entered as a matter of abstract geopolitics, its particular battles will ultimately involve local and regional economies and jobs—with potentially unexpected ramifications. As we wrote before, “trade involves millions of workers in hundreds of real and varied places, and often drives crucial local commerce.” The implication: any coming trade wars will not be remote from America’s local communities, which will likely not remain silent about their views of any potential dislocation.

Which brings up the matter of politics. Here, the data and its geography—likely intentional—seem to guarantee that no clean political divide separates tariff-affected counties from others. Instead, the Chinese tariff lists seem designed to ensure that both parties—and virtually all parts of the country—are maximally disturbed by the ongoing saber-rattling. On the one hand, the 2.1 million potentially tariff-affected jobs are almost evenly distributed in counties that President Trump and Hillary Clinton won in the 2016 election. Along those lines we estimate that some 1,062,000 of the exposed jobs (52 percent of them) lie in red counties and 976,000 in blue counties. That means that both red state and blue state members of Congress will be activated by the faceoff.

Yet on the other hand, the Chinese tariff lists seem optimally designed to especially agitate President Trump’s red-state base. After all, of the 2,742 counties with employment in the industries potentially impacted by the current Chinese tariffs, 2,247 (82 percent) of those counties voted for Trump in 2016, while just 439 (18 percent) supported Clinton.

The upshot: Although select blue-state Democrats will be concerned about threats to aerospace jobs in Washington and pharmaceutical manufacturing jobs in New Jersey and Minnesota, red-state Republican senators and representatives, many of whom have long been proponents of freer trade, must almost all be getting nervous.

In any event, the tariff-impacts map suggests Chinese officials have a canny feel for the geography of U.S. trade exposure and are pushing buttons that ensure the U.S. political system mobilizes pushback.

At the same time, the Trump administration’s apparent seriousness about continuing the standoff guarantees maximum uncertainty for the global economy in the coming months.

In the meantime, however, the intimation of the map is simpler: President Trump’s actions on trade are no longer just talk; they could soon have real implications for real jobs in real local economies.

The move has obviously drawn close attention in New Delhi. And despite seeming a challenge, it may hide a rare opportunity. If India leans into policy boldness, the tariffs could act not as a brake on Indian ambition—but a powerful accelerant for structural reform and global competitiveness.

India has long used tariffs to protect its domestic industries. At 17.1 percent, India's average applied tariff rate remains among the highest in the world. Key sectors from automobiles to electronics to agriculture have long benefited from these protectionist measures and often at the expense of scale and global integration. A moment of external pressure could provide just the jolt needed to course-correct.

A Strategic Opening in the China +1 Landscape

Once implemented, the new tariff regime announced by the United States can reshuffle the competitive landscape across Asia. While India faces an average tariff of 27% on exports to the U.S., other competitors face even higher tariffs: China now contends with 34%, Vietnam 46%, Bangladesh 37%, and Thailand 36%.

Country Average Tariff (%) Vietnam 46.0 Thailand 36.0 Bangladesh 37.0 China 34.0 India 27.0

Assuming these tariff rates hold, this presents New Delhi with a significant opportunity. As U.S. companies look to diversify their supply chains and reduce dependence on China, traditional “China Plus-One” destinations like Vietnam and Thailand now face even steeper tariff barriers. India suddenly finds itself with a unique advantage in scale, capability, and now—relative tariff attractiveness.

>>> What Made America Great in the Gilded Age

Many sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, auto components, and precision engineering, where China and Southeast Asian economies previously held the edge, are now fair game. Tariff parity hasn’t just leveled the playing field. It’s tipped it in India’s favor.

An Opportunity to Reform and Rationalize Tariff Structures

India’s tariff structure was historically designed to protect infant industries but many of those sectors have since matured and are ready to compete globally. Reducing tariffs now could unlock competitiveness by lowering input costs for domestic manufacturers, incentivizing scale and innovation in export-driven sectors, and creating room for deeper bilateral negotiations. And we are already seeing some movement in this direction. Since Trump 2.0, India has quietly but swiftly removed or reduced tariffs in areas like electronic components, industrial inputs, electric vehicles, and more.

Sector/Item Previous Tariff (%) Revised Tariff (%) Change Type Notes EV Battery Production Items 10-20% (varied) 0% Exemption 35 Items Exempted to boost local EV battery manufacturing (Mar. 2025) Mobile Phone Components 10-15% (varied) 0% Exemption 28 items exempted for local electronics production (Mar. 2025) Motorcycles <1600cc 50% 40% Reduction Aimed at high-end two-wheelers and luxury imports Motorcycles >1600cc 50% 30% Reduction Part of broader luxury auto policy changes Solar Cells & Modules 40% 20% Reduction Promote solar manufacturing and renewable energy sector

A broad-based tariff reform like the GST rollout under Modi 1.0 or the production-linked incentive schemes of Modi 2.0 could become a defining economic milestone of Modi 3.0. Rather than viewing the latest U.S. tariffs as a setback, India can treat this moment as a strategic opening: a chance to revisit its tariff logic, accelerate long-needed reforms, and assert itself as a truly global manufacturing hub.



Global Operations, Indian Origins

Another under-discussed advantage lies in the globalization of Indian conglomerates. Companies like JSW and Epsilon are no longer just exporters; they have become investors, manufacturers, and employers on U.S. soil. This evolution cushions the impact of tariffs by anchoring operations within the U.S. market, while simultaneously strengthening India’s image as a mature, globally integrated economic partner. Far from conflicting with the ""Make in India"" vision, these moves represent its extension: “Innovate in India, Operate Globally.”

A New Chance at a U.S.–India Trade Architecture

U.S. tariffs may finally create the political urgency needed to revive discussions around a comprehensive U.S.–India trade agreement. The elusive India-U.S. trade deal has been a relationship goal since the first Trump administration. However, it has repeatedly stalled over disagreements on agriculture, e-commerce, digital services, and pharmaceutical pricing.

>>> America Needs Taiwan To Win the Semiconductor Race

We are already seeing action again early in the second Trump administration. In late March 2025, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for South and Central Asia, Brendan Lynch, led a delegation to New Delhi for a series of discussions with Indian officials. This engagement followed a visit earlier in March by India's Commerce and Industry Minister, Piyush Goyal, to Washington, D.C., where he met with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

The urgency of these negotiations has been amplified by President Trump’s decision to impose a 27% tariff on Indian goods. India’s response thus far has been to continue pursuing a bilateral trade agreement, viewing it as an opportunity to address mutual concerns and expand market access.

The Catalyst We Didn’t Ask For—But Might Need

India has long aspired to be recognized as a global manufacturing and innovation leader. That moment is now within reach and it calls for bold policy choices. Rather than a setback, the current tariff landscape could serve as a springboard to modernize India’s trade architecture, solidify its role in regional supply chains, and deepen its strategic and economic partnership with the United States. With the right response, India can turn disruption into direction—and momentum into lasting global influence."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Heritage Foundation,https://www.heritage.org/energy/commentary/even-new-ev-tariffs-bidens-climate-agenda-benefits-china,"Even With New EV Tariffs, Biden’s Climate Agenda Benefits China","Erin Walsh, Commentary By, Former Senior Research Fellow In National Security, Senior Associate, National Security Coalitions",,"President Joe Biden announced Tuesday that he will raise tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. But make no mistake—even with the new tariffs, his administration's green agenda benefits China immensely.

To date, President Biden's plan to build “America's clean energy future” has resulted in expensive gas, problematic regulations, and arbitrary environmental standards, all of which have benefitted the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) while harming U.S. prosperity and national security.

Now, Biden is reportedly considering declaring a “national climate emergency,” and climate activists around the country are applauding him for it. Though their praise may be more muted, you can be sure that the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are doing the same.

China has benefited from the U.S.' environmental movement for decades. In 1992, Premier Li Peng insisted that developed countries are obligated to support developing countries and even transfer technology in the name of a cleaner environment. Even as China's fossil fuels and domestic coal production surged exponentially, Beijing positioned itself as an international champion of the climate agenda.

>>> EPA’s New Power Plant Rule Will Cause Catastrophic Energy Scarcity

Unfortunately, the smokescreen worked. Prominent U.S. politicians such as Al Gore and John Kerry worked tirelessly on international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which restricted avenues for U.S. energy production while allowing China to continue building coal power plants.

Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China has accelerated its strategy at America's expense, and things have only gotten worse under the Biden administration.

Early on, Beijing recognized that the administration believes climate change—not China—is the number-one national security threat to the U.S., and it took advantage. At every turn, the CCP has used the specter of climate catastrophe to push the Biden administration to sacrifice American interests in favor of climate agreements. For example, last year, the Biden administration shelved sanctions on Chinese officials and details on the Chinese spy balloon to preserve climate cooperation and not provoke Beijing.

Today, China's manufacturing sector has secured chokeholds not only on electric vehicles, but on many of the world's green energy products, such as solar panels and wind turbines. Indeed, almost every ambitious target adopted by climate change activists pushing President Biden to declare a national emergency would require mass adoption of heavily subsidized Chinese “green” technologies and equipment.

Take solar panels, for instance. China's anticompetitive practices mean American solar panel producers cannot compete with cheap Chinese solar panels subsidized by the CCP and often built using slave labor from the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, where China is actively committing genocide against Uyghur Muslims. The problem is so bad that today China accounts for 75 percent of all solar panels produced globally, leaving only 16 companies building solar panels in America.

China is also the world's largest producer and processor of rare earth elements, which are essential for green energy products and technologies, such as the lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles. For the Biden administration to meet its goal of 50 percent of cars sold in 2030 being zero-emission electric vehicles, it would require “ten times the amount of rare earth elements [the U.S.] currently has” domestically. In other words, Biden is making America's automobile industry dependent on China.

>>> Green Housing Mandates Are Pushing Americans More Into the Red

It doesn't have to be this way. Regardless of one's opinion about climate change, there's simply no reason to believe that China is an ally or can be considered a trustworthy partner.

President Biden's current plan for America's “clean energy future” allows our number-one adversary to control vast swathes of our energy infrastructure, deprives millions of Americans of well-paying jobs, and does little to help the environment.

Biden would be wise to stop pursuing this counterproductive agenda and start prioritizing American energy independence by withdrawing from costly agreements that restrict our energy production and give the CCP a competitive advantage.

The CCP has consistently taken advantage of America's climate agenda to advance its own narrow interests, putting U.S. national and energy security at grave risk. In the years ahead, the U.S. must put an end to China's manipulation of the climate agenda and put the American people first."

With housing affordability threatened, American home builders are asking the Biden administration to temporarily lift tariffs on building materials such as steel and lumber from China and Canada.

Duties on Canadian softwood lumber have gone on quite a ride in recent years, rising to 20.2% in 2017 and then settling down to 8.9% last year. However, this May, the U.S. Commerce Department announced it was taking steps to boost tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imports once again. In late November, the Commerce Department reported that the average tariff will double, back up to 17.9%.

>>> Global Trade Freedom Has Declined for the Fourth Straight Year

These tariffs act as a tax on consumers and exacerbate price volatility. Lumber prices skyrocketed this past year, adding almost $36,000 to the cost of a new single-family home. Factor in ongoing supply chain issues, and it’s no surprise homebuilding has slowed. The gap between houses under construction and completed houses was the largest on record in September.

Ultimately, these duties benefit only American lumber producers, who seek to protect their market share. For decades, they have accused Canadian producers of “dumping” their lower-priced lumber in the U.S., and every time, international trade arbiters have cleared Canadian lumber producers of the charge. Moreover, the U.S. International Trade Commission has found that Canadian lumber imports are not a threat to the American industry, so there’s no justification for slapping duties on them.

American lobbyists are good at getting what they want, but tariffs are a lousy way to treat any trading partner, much less a close friend and ally. They do no favors for this country either. Jacking up duties on Canadian lumber will result in thousands of job losses on both sides of the border, whether it’s American home builders or Canadian sawmill workers. These individuals should not be put out of work just to line the pockets of U.S. lumber producers—especially now when both economies are grappling with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

When thinking of home builders, it’s easy to picture large developers. Still, most National Association of Home Builders members start 10 or fewer homes per year, and about half of them have five or fewer employees. In other words, it’s mostly small employers, not faceless corporations, that are suffering. And with governments tending to impose tariffs on materials that go into life’s necessities, like food, clothing and shelter, it’s everyday consumers who are hurt the most.

It’s no surprise, then, that countries with fewer trade restrictions are more prosperous than those that restrict trade. According to the Heritage Foundation’s latest annual Index of Economic Freedom, the United States isn’t even in the top 10 freest economies in the world. In fact, at number 20, there’s a lot of room for improvement if the Biden administration is looking for something useful to do.

To be fair, at the recent G20 summit, the U.S. president announced plans to ease tariffs on steel and aluminum coming from the European Union. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo expressed confidence that the move will ease supply chain pressures, drive down cost increases, and be beneficial for American manufacturers who use these materials in their products.

The move is also expected to ease some tension on the strained trans-Atlantic relationship between the U.S. and the EU nations. But what about the relationship with Canada? And what about cost relief for millions of American homebuyers? The lumber tariff increases will hit American consumers hard, as lumber costs today remain nearly double what they were pre-pandemic.

>>> Tariffs Are Never a Good Idea. Those on Aluminum Are Especially Bad.

President Biden has committed to trade policies that protect and empower American workers. Well, in 2019, more than 4.4 million Americans made their living in residential construction. These jobs—and the dream of homeownership for many Americans—are directly attacked by import duties. Moreover, as a recent Wall Street Journal editorial noted, this type of measure flies in the face of the Biden administration’s expressed desire to fight inflation.

Canada and the U.S. remain strong allies and crucial trading partners in our uncertain world. In 2019, Canada was the third-largest exporter of goods to the U.S. and the second-largest supplier of agricultural products. And it goes both ways—Canada is also the second-largest export market for American agricultural products.

The Biden administration should roll back tariffs on softwood lumber from Canada as it has done with steel and aluminum. There are enough economic and trade troubles in the world today. The mutually beneficial Canada-U.S. relationship should not become one of them."

Those on Aluminum Are Especially Bad.,"Patrick Tyrrell, Commentary By, Former Research Coordinator, Research Fellow, Editor Of The Index Of Economic Freedom",,"Aluminum prices are up 59% from a year ago, and America’s 10% tariffs on the metal are not relieving any headaches at beer and non-alcoholic beverage manufacturers.

The tariffs were originally put in place in 2018, ostensibly to protect domestic aluminum producers. The theory was that China and other foreign producers were “dumping” aluminum into the U.S. at low prices below cost, to capture market share and supposedly drive American producers of aluminum out of business.

In fact, the idea of dumping is one of the great unicorns of trade policy: oft-imagined but rarely seen in reality. Even state-supported Chinese firms cannot sustain such losses, bleeding money with each shipment of aluminum sent across the ocean.

Unfortunately, President Joe Biden has tightened the tariffs since coming into office. One of his first actions as president was to reinstate aluminum tariffs on aluminum exported from the United Arab Emirates that had been previously lifted.

Consequently, aluminum prices are now much higher than they were in 2018, when the 10% tariffs were originally inflicted on American users of the metal. As for China, it is now a net importer of aluminum, and things are getting worse for aluminum users around the world.

>>> Americans Do Not Need More Steel Tariffs

A coup in Guinea over the weekend caused prices to jump upward from what was already a 10-year high. Guinea is the world’s largest exporter of bauxite, a key ingredient in aluminum, and the conflict there puts the metal’s supply chain at risk.

Monster Beverage Corp.’s co-CEO has warned that the stratospheric climb in prices has put that company in “uncharted territory,” and Heineken has said that the out-of-control prices will have a “material effect” on the strength of its business.

That translates into higher costs for manufacturers, meaning less resources available to expand, create employment opportunities, and provide new products.

The beverage industry has been especially hard hit. According to the Beer Institute, even before the aluminum tariffs, “aluminum cans [were] already the single largest cost in American beer production. Cans [made] up 11.4% of the cost of manufacturing beer in the U.S.”

Beer, ale, and other malt beverages at home prices rose 2.1% from July 2020 to July 2021, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index released in August.

The aluminum tariff is an unnecessary tax on beverage makers and all users of aluminum and it is made worse by the recent jump in the price of the metal. It is high time to stop taxing Americans for the simple act of having a cola or a beer.

Smith, Commentary By, Former Jay Van Andel Senior Policy Analyst In Trade Policy, Summer Member Of The Young Leaders Program At The Heritage Foundation",,"Earlier this month, the Senate approved the 2021 United States Innovation and Competition Act, which includes a significant trade amendment called the Trade Act of 2021. The amendment renews two tariff-cutting trade programs, the Generalized System of Preferences and the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill.

While the renewal of these programs would represent a huge tax savings for American businesses and families, the Trade Act of 2021 also includes new burdensome requirements for imports to qualify for the Generalized System of Preferences.

The Generalized System of Preferences reduces tariffs on goods from developing countries and saves American families and businesses more than $1 billion annually. The Generalized System of Preferences expired on Dec. 31 of last year. Americans paid roughly $308 million in costly tariffs between January and April this year as a result.

The Trade Act of 2021 renews and expands the Generalized System of Preferences, for better and worse. Past bills renewed the program for two years while the Trade Act of 2021 extends it for six years. A step in the right direction, renewing the program for six years will allow businesses to plan and function without the uncertainty caused by tariff threats.

Unfortunately, the Trade Act of 2021 also revises Generalized System of Preferences’ requirements by making it more difficult for countries to qualify for Generalized System of Preferences’ benefits.

For example, under this Trade Act, countries that do not promote “women’s economic empowerment” could be ineligible for Generalized System of Preferences’ benefits. These requirements are ambiguous, unnecessary, and unrelated to trade.

Regarding these extended requirements, the Generalized System of Preferences’ Coalition stated it “has concerns that this bill contains many new ‘sticks’ but no new ‘carrots’ to incentivize GSP countries to meet proposed higher standards.” The Generalized System of Preferences is meant to increase trade between the U.S. and developing countries. This version could do the opposite.

Miscellaneous Tariff bills eliminate tariffs on goods not available domestically. The 2018 Miscellaneous Tariff Bill expired on Dec. 31. Since then, Americans have paid more than $1.3 million per day in unnecessary tariffs to import products that would be tariff-free. Many of these imports are raw materials and other intermediate goods—inputs—that American companies use to create finished goods.

The Trade Act of 2021 modifies tariffs for more than 3,000 miscellaneous imports for two years, until December 2023. Furthermore, it reauthorizes the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act to preserve the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill petition process until 2025.

In its current form, the Trade Act of 2021 could jeopardize the savings that American businesses and families enjoy from Generalized System of Preferences by holding them hostage to issues unrelated to trade.

As the House of Representatives evaluates the broader United States Innovation and Competition Act package, members should consider stripping the new General System of Preferences’ regulations from the legislation but keep the renewal of both trade programs intact. Doing so would allow the tariff savings of the Generalized System of Preferences and Miscellaneous Tariff Bill programs to be fully experienced by Americans.

Should the United States Innovation and Competition Act fail or get delayed in the House, Congress should still pursue renewal of these trade programs in new legislation that places the focus where it needs to be—on reducing tariffs to help the competitiveness of American businesses—rather than placing unnecessary and unrelated regulations on the benefits that tariff reductions provide.

The lumber needed to build a new home now costs nearly $36,000 more than just 12 months ago.

The reasons include lower production levels at U.S. sawmills when the pandemic was raging, high demand for new homes as millennials enter the peak homebuying age group, and increased use of lumber by do-it-yourselfers on home improvement projects as they spend more time in their homes.

One thing the government can do to inject relief is remove the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber (9% since last December; 20% before that).

According to proponents, the tariffs—dubbed “countervailing duties”—are meant to protect the U.S. lumber industry from what they claim are unfair Canadian subsidies.

Timber harvested from Canadian government land, for example, can enjoy a price advantage over U.S. timber grown on private lands. What’s not clear, however, is why the government should require U.S. consumers and homebuilders to bear the burden of supporting U.S. growers who can’t compete.

The result is suppressed activity in the U.S. homebuilding industry, fewer construction jobs, and fewer options for homebuyers, who may be forced to settle for smaller homes, or ones with fewer amenities.

Some families who would otherwise buy a new home opt to buy older homes. Others stay in their current homes longer.

U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai is meeting with her Canadian and Mexican counterparts this week to discuss what progress is being made under the new North American trade agreement, and U.S. homebuilders and many lawmakers want her to remove the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber.

White House chief economist Cecilia Rouse said Friday the Biden administration is “weighing concerns about commodity shortages and inflation as it reviews trade tariff policy.”

Given the high and growing demand for lumber to feed pent-up demand in the U.S. homebuilding sector, it would be beneficial for both the U.S. and Canada to reach a permanent agreement on softwood lumber imports from Canada that allows trade to flow unimpeded.

From a broader perspective, it should be noted that Canada and the United States have a profound and multifaceted partnership and alliance, strengthened by shared values and interests. Protectionist measures are a drag on our mutual economic recovery from the ongoing pandemic and progress toward greater prosperity.

Indeed, lingering protectionism, as shown in the Canadian softwood lumber case, threatens to undermine much-needed greater economic dynamism.

A recent Wall Street Journal editorial made a timely and strong case against the tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber, noting:

Canadian lumber can provide a safety-valve for supply amid U.S. shortages, but not since the tariff. … This backward-looking assignment of duties introduces enormous uncertainty, creating an incentive to rely on domestic supply. President [Joe] Biden said as a candidate that he opposes the Trump tariffs on allies. How about killing this one to help American homebuyers?

Let’s hope Tai gets that message.

But before leaving office, former President Donald Trump put washer tariffs on repeat for another two years.

Americans have paid taxes of up to 50% on washers and their inputs since the tariffs were first put in place in Jan. 2018. Whirlpool, the primary beneficiary of these tariffs, argued then that foreign competition from companies like Samsung and LG was causing injury to the domestic industry, and that import tariffs were necessary to “safeguard” American manufactures.

Since 2018, prices on washing machines have increased by 12%, or almost $100 per unit, as a direct result of these tariffs. In total, consumers have paid an additional $1.5 billion annually in higher prices, which far surpasses the $82 million made in tariff revenue.

A representative from LG warned against the move, stating back in 2018: “This is a tax on every consumer who wants to buy a washing machine. Everyone will pay more, with fewer choices.”

But rather than appeal to American families, Whirlpool instead pushed for another three years of protections. In 2020, Whirlpool filed for an extension of tariffs under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, testified in front of the International Trade Commission on the company’s behalf, arguing:

Samsung and LG have gone to great lengths to put American producers out of business and dominate the U.S. washer market… An extension of the safeguard is necessary to ensure American companies like Whirlpool are able to compete on a level playing field.

In November 2020, the International Trade Commission agreed with Brown and Whirlpool, recommending an extension of the tariffs for an additional two years. In the official report, the commission pointed to COVID-19 as a major reason for postponing their expiration, claiming that the pandemic prevented domestic manufacturers from realizing the full tariff benefit and affected their ability to appropriately adjust to competition.

But Whirlpool had already been struggling pre-pandemic. Even with two years of tariffs on its competition under its belt, Whirlpool’s 2019 net sales still tanked by more than 5% compared to the previous year. And like its competitors, Whirlpool ultimately raised its prices to make up for lost revenue.

While it’s true that Whirlpool has been able to add 200 new jobs since the measures were first implemented, its foreign competitors have also made contributions to the U.S. labor force. Samsung and LG were both in the process of opening manufacturing plants at the time the tariffs were first introduced, and although it came as a major blow to their operations, these facilities created more than 1,500 new jobs for Americans.

Although Whirlpool, LG, and Samsung created over 1,700 new jobs for Americans, which is welcome news, comparing those numbers against consumer costs paints a different picture. Because families ultimately bear the tariff burden downstream in the form of higher prices, import taxes on washing machines have cost Americans over $800,000 per job created.

It certainly comes as no surprise that Whirlpool commended the Trump administration’s extension, proclaiming, “[this] culminates a nearly decade-long effort by Whirlpool Corporation to help ensure free and fair trade policies that benefit both our consumers and our 15,000 U.S. employees.”

But a policy that costs Americans over $236 million in unnecessary taxes on washer imports and panders to special interests is not “free” nor “fair.”

The Biden administration should immediately press “cancel” on this cycle and reverse these costly tariffs.

Smith, Former Jay Van Andel Senior Policy Analyst In Trade Policy, Smith Provided The Conservative True North On Free Trade Through Her Research",,"Is the Trump administration about to impose new tariffs on imported steel from other countries? In the wake of a new report from Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross—one that examines the effect that imports of specialized electrical steel have had on U.S. national security—it just might.

The Commerce report isn't public yet, but there is word that it could recommend new tariffs on steel imports from nearly every country in the world. The administration has a history of imposing national security tariffs on steel imports, even on U.S. allies.

Commerce's report covered imported grain-oriented electrical steel, used primarily to create transformers for use in the broader electrical grid. More than 85% of such steel is imported from Canada and Mexico. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative recently announced that Mexico would not be subject to new tariffs; our southern neighbor would instead institute an export monitoring system for specialized electrical steel products.

While imports from Mexico seem to be safe for now from tariffs, we don't know if the Commerce report determined that these imports threatened U.S. national security or the fate of electrical steel imports from any other countries. The Trump administration has also used monitoring systems like this in the past to impose tariffs later, as Canada just experienced this firsthand.

Existing national security tariffs on steel imports—including on some primary electrical steel—have not benefitted American families or the U.S. economy. After tariffs of 25% were imposed in March 2018, it is estimated that a few thousand steel jobs were created in the short term, but without tariffs they are not sustainable.

American families and businesses have paid $7.5 billion in extra steel tariffs since 2018, a cost that continues to grow each day.

At the same time, American businesses that use steel to produce other goods saw the price of imported steel and domestically produced steel go up. The price of domestic steel increased because the tariffs increased the cost of importing steel, so more importers looked to buy domestic.

However, the industry could not meet the drastic increase in demand, and so the prices skyrocketed.

The steel tariffs increased domestic steel prices by nearly 40% in the months immediately following the imposition of tariffs. Today, prices have stabilized to pre-tariff rates, as some countries and companies have received exemptions from the tariffs.

Businesses have also implemented cost-cutting measures, such as delaying capital investment plans and even reducing their number of employees.

For many businesses, the tariffs caused long-term damage. For example, Mid-Continent Nail, located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, had to wait 10 months for an exemption from the 2018 steel tariffs. In the meantime, the company's sales dropped by 60%, and it lost more than 200 employees.

AK Steel, which is owned by Cleveland-Cliffs, is the only U.S. company that produces the electrical steel that could face higher tariffs under this new investigation.

The company claims that the 2018 steel tariffs contained a loophole and that more tariffs are needed, otherwise it will ""shut down the plants in Butler and Zanesville."" The 2018 tariffs made AK Steel's intermediate steel products more expensive, whether it sourced domestically or internationally.

These tariffs also did nothing to make America safer. In fact, Defense Secretary James Mattis contested the 2018 report determining that steel imports threatened to impair U.S. national security.

Prior to 2018, Americans primarily imported steel from allies such as Canada, Japan, South Korea and Germany. Furthermore, only 3% of U.S. steel production is used by the Department of Defense each year, and existing laws restrict the level of foreign content permitted for steel products procured by the Defense Department.

The 2018 steel tariffs did not help Americans. There is no reason to believe that tariffs on electrical steel will be any different. What we do know about tariffs is that they have an immense cost on American families and businesses.

Ron Harper, president of Cogent Power Inc., told Power Transformer News that new tariffs on grain-oriented electrical steel ""has the potential to have a major cost impact on U.S. transformer manufacturers and utilities.""

In a recent letter to Ross, five members of Congress stated that tariffs on grain-oriented electrical steel would harm jobs in downstream industries, increase electricity prices, delay electrical grid upgrades as well as make upgrades more costly.

The Trump administration should learn from its previous experience with steel tariffs and refrain from imposing new costs on American families and businesses. Instead, the administration should focus on advancing a pro-growth agenda that will help the economy recover from the pandemic slowdown."

Congress took some actions to ease regulations for businesses during the crisis,REF but ultimately the bills will increase the federal deficit by $2.1 trillion during fiscal year (FY) 2020.REF At the same time, these policies add to the growing national debt, which is already roughly 107 percent of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).REF

On the other hand, this crisis has served as an opportunity to eliminate or temporarily suspend burdensome regulations, such as those that made it more difficult to use telemedicine.REF Congress and the Administration should search for additional ways to permanently eliminate red tape and make it easier for people to improve their lives.

Using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) databaseREF and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model,REF this Backgrounder demonstrates the estimated effects of removing tariffs on manufactured goods imports.REF Permanently removing these tariffs—which are 1.1 percent on averageREF—would increase U.S. exports in all sectors, reduce prices paid by consumers, increase U.S. GDP, and create more and better-paying jobs.

All of these outcomes represent increased opportunity for millions of Americans to improve their living standards. American businesses would sell more, families would get more for their money, and people would be better off. Reducing or eliminating tariffs in other sectors should provide similar or better results because tariffs in other sectors are higher. Congress should start permanently cutting these tariffs today, starting with those on manufactured goods. The manufacturing sector has been at the forefront of the Administration’s trade agenda and would benefit measurably from tariff reduction.

Estimated Effects of Eliminating Manufactured Goods Tariffs

The United States has generally low tariff rates. In 2017, for example, the average tariff paid by Americans to buy from abroad was roughly 1.6 percent.REF Low tariffs give American families and businesses access to more competitively priced goods, whether those goods are made in the United States or imported from abroad. Americans also enjoy more options and greater innovation thanks to free trade.REF If the United States removed the tariffs that remain on the books, starting with tariffs on manufactured goods, these benefits would increase.

Using the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) database,REF the manufacturing industry includes 17 goods-producing sectorsREF ranging from leather production to transport equipment production, with an average tariff rate of 1.1 percent.REF The authors modeled the effects of removing these low tariffs using a CGE model.REF These results demonstrate some of the benefits of removing tariffs on manufactured goods, including impacts on import prices, imports, exports, and consumer prices. More detailed results can be found in the Appendix. The following results are changes that could be expected within the year that the tariff removal is implemented:REF

Price of imported manufactured goods decreases by over 2 percent. As supply chains have become more integrated, the lower price for imported manufactured goods could benefit all sectors. American companies that import manufactured inputs could increase production due to the decrease in costs as a result of the tariff removal. For example, zero tariffs on machinery and equipment imports (such as shovels, hoes, or parts for tractors) could decrease the prices farmers have to pay for their equipment. This would give farmers additional resources to reinvest in their businesses and ultimately lead to lower prices for consumers. The result is more economic growth, which means more jobs and higher living standards.

As removing tariffs on imported manufactured goods would make them cheaper, the U.S. manufacturing industry would increase imports of manufactured goods by almost 4.5 percent. In response, imports in all other sectors would slightly decline by an average of less than 0.5 percent. For example, a farmer may end up buying an American-made tractor that is now cheaper because the American tractor maker would now face lower input costs. These lower input costs allow the American business selling tractors to reduce prices, creating more competition and increasing exports. Again, when the tariff is removed, American families and business are left with additional resources to improve their living standards.

The American manufacturing industry would see the greatest gains in terms of increased exports, with an increase reaching almost 3 percent. REF But the effects would ripple out to other sectors as well. Agricultural exports would increase by almost 1 percent. Exports in extraction—which covers forestry, fishing, coal, oil, gas, and minerals—would increase by almost 2 percent. Exports in textiles and services would increase by about 1 percent. These increases in exports are in response to the decreased costs in the integrated supply chains caused by the removal of tariffs on imported manufactured goods and would be seen by many American businesses. To keep up with these additional exports, American companies would need to either hire more workers or invest in more productive capital, both of which yields economic growth and higher living standards.

Prices decrease for Americans. Manufactured goods prices would decrease by almost 1 percent, and prices of all goods would decrease on average by almost 0.25 percent. These tariff-free imports would make inputs such as metals (included in the manufacturing sector in the GTAP database) cheaper. For example, if a nail maker imports steel from Brazil, as that steel no longer has a tariff applied to it, the American nail maker could produce and export more nails by offering lower prices, which would also be seen by Americans at the hardware store. The result is that American families will have more money to cover daily expenses, save, or invest.

Though the manufacturing sector would see some job losses, job creation in other, often higher-paying sectors would increase. In the CGE model, results for sub-sectors of manufacturing—such as leather, wood, chemical, and coal products as well as motor vehicles and basic pharmaceuticals—are aggregated, so some jobs would be created in some sub-sectors despite an overall decrease in the aggregated manufacturing sector. Some may view the decrease in manufacturing jobs as a justification for keeping the tariffs in place, but in reality, removing the tariffs would force a shift in labor resources to more productive uses. This process yields economic growth, higher wages, and greater opportunity.

The tariff removal on manufactured goods would increase GDP by 0.002 percent, or $412 million annually, based on 2014 levels.REF The proper metric to determine the efficacy of a specific economic policy should be the impact on the overall economy over time and not on a specific industry, especially in the near term. By this standard, reducing tariffs is good policy.

Further, even if one wanted to bias the economy away from overall health and toward simply increasing manufacturing jobs, despite the collateral economic damage, tariffs are the wrong tool. Evidence shows, for instance, that increased tariffs in the manufacturing sector have created large negative effects (such as from higher input costs and retaliatory tariffs) that ultimately reduced manufacturing employment.REF To demonstrate these types of effects, we imposed a 1 percent tariff on manufactured goods in addition to the baseline tariffs.

Higher Tariffs Increase Jobs at a Significant Cost

Advocates of tariffs on manufactured goods argue that policies are needed to level the playing field for American manufacturers. The alleged goal is often to increase manufacturing jobs and bring back jobs and production that previously moved offshore. For example, since 1963, the United States has had a 25 percent tariff on light truck imports.REF American truck manufacturers claim they need this tariff to ensure a “level playing field,”REF even though it ultimately results in American consumers paying more for trucks. Similarly, the American Iron and Steel Institute stated that the 2018 tariff on imported steel “is critical to ensuring steel remains a vital asset for our national and economic security.”REF However, sustained job growth has not occurred in the industry as a result of the tariffs.REF

Using the same CGE modelREF and GTAP database,REF we modeled the effects of increasing tariffs on manufactured goods. A 1 percent tariff was applied to the baseline for both light manufactured goods imports and heavy manufactured goods imports, resulting in an average applied tariff rate of 2 percent.REF The model predicts that the tariff increase would add more than 66,000 jobs to the manufacturing sector.REF This result is not surprising because a higher tariff would depress imports of manufactured goods, increasing demand for those made domestically.

However, those jobs come at a significant cost to others in the economy. While the manufacturing industry gains jobs, the remaining sectors lose nearly 70,000 jobs for a net decrease of more than 3,000 jobs.REF The negative employment effect on the overall economy of imposing a 1 percent tariff is also greater than the positive employment effect of eliminating tariffs on the sector. Americans would also experience a decrease in GDP of $592 million,REF an increase in consumer prices for all goods, and a decrease in exports for all goods.REF

This negative effect on the economy can be attributed partly to a decrease in competition. Tariffs artificially raise the prices of imported products, which can make them more expensive than domestically produced goods. This price increase can discourage some businesses in the sector from innovating in ways that could help their competitiveness. If businesses are not innovative, they can maintain inefficient processes that prevent them from offering more competitive prices, higher quality products, or even better jobs.REF Therefore, the tariffs disincentivize innovation and allow businesses to maintain higher prices or suboptimal products.

Still, so long as the goods are somewhat substitutable with the imported products, more businesses will buy the domestically produced goods. It is possible that any resulting increase in sales can create jobs in the domestic manufacturing sector, but all businesses that must now purchase more expensive inputs will be faced with having to counter the increased input costs. In the model, the agriculture, extraction, textile, and service sectors realize these higher costs because they utilize manufactured goods. At the same time, exports from all sectors are negatively affected because of the decrease in U.S. competitiveness in foreign markets due to higher costs imposed by the tariffs.

Increasing jobs, while a noble goal, should not be the primary driver of trade policy. In fact, eliminating or imposing tariffs and other trade measures solely to create jobs in a particular sector is likely to have negative consequences for the broader economy. Americans are better served by a trade policy that promotes the freedom for individuals to make choices without government intervention.

A Pro-Growth Trade Agenda

Prior to the pandemic, the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of imports from around the world. For example, the average tariff rate paid by Americans to buy from China increased from 3.1 percent in 2018 to 19.3 percent in 2020.REF Tariffs imposed by the U.S. act as a sales tax on American families and businesses that buy products or inputs from abroad. New tariffs imposed on imports have cost Americans nearly $70 billion since 2018REF and are estimated to reduce long-term GDP by 0.23 percent.REF

Removing these barriers would be a boon for the U.S. economy and a huge savings for the Americans who have been footing the bill. The tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration can be removed through executive action or if Congress amends the statutes used to implement the tariffs. Absent either of these actions, there is another option.

Congress routinely advances legislation to temporarily eliminate tariffs on certain imports through the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill and the Generalized System of Preferences. These programs are up for renewal in 2020 and typically receive overwhelming support.REF Congress should go further by permanently eliminating tariffs on all imports of manufactured goods.

Recommendations

Tariffs are a costly tax on American businesses and families. Cutting these burdensome taxes should be a cornerstone of any strategy to help people expand their economic opportunities, especially during the post-pandemic recovery.

To advance a pro-growth trade policy, Congress and the Administration should:

Remove tariffs imposed since 2018. Tariffs imposed since 2018 have cost Americans nearly $70 billion and will have a long-term negative impact on GDP. These tariffs are sabotaging people’s efforts to improve their lives.

Renew tariff preference programs. The Miscellaneous Tariff Bill and Generalized System of Preferences temporarily eliminate tariffs for certain imports. These programs expire in December 2020 and should be renewed.

Conclusion

Trying to calibrate tariffs to achieve some politically defined optimal level of manufacturing would ultimately do far more harm than good—even in manufacturing. That happens for a number of reasons. Each rule and regulation imposed on consumers and businesses creates inefficiency and economic loss. Over time, these add up and result in fewer resources to purchase goods or to save and invest. Further, such a system necessarily isolates certain favored companies and sectors from competition, which removes incentives to invest in new technologies or products. At the same time, it gives special government privileges to firms that would otherwise not be competitive. This dynamic ultimately leaves Americans with fewer jobs, lower wages, higher prices, and less choice.

The Administration and Congress have the choice not to take such a path. The positive economic effects of cutting tariffs are undeniable. As shown in this model, an average tariff rate cut of 1.1 percent on manufactured goods would increase trade—including U.S. exports—and reduce costs for American families and businesses. Congress and the Administration should start cutting tariffs today, beginning with those on manufactured goods.

Appendix: Methodology and Results Tables

CGE models are systems of equations that describe the incentives and behaviors of producers and consumers in an economy and the linkages between them.REF This idea is known as a circular flow and is the combination of private household demand, government demand, and investor demand that is met by firms, which complete the flow of income and spending by buying inputs, hiring workers, and employing capital that is used in their production processes.REF

We use the GTAP database to develop a small six-sector and three-factor database for 2014 for the United States and an aggregated rest-of-world region. The sectors are agriculture, extraction, textiles, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, and services, and the three factors of production are land, labor, and capital, which are in fixed supply.

In the CGE model, tariffs are removed (and later added) on light and heavy manufactured goods to assess the impact on consumer prices, import prices, trade flows, and GDP. A shock—that is, the tariff removal (or application)—creates a disequilibrium that changes the economy in the model. The tariff removal is expected to decrease consumer prices and increase consumer demand, decrease the import price of manufactured goods imports and in turn increase manufactured goods imports, increase domestic production to meet the increase in consumer demand (which could increase exports), and increase GDP. The opposite is the case for the tariff application, but in both cases, the new values, which are the changes from the base rate (2014), represent the new equilibrium where quantities of supply and demand are again equal at a new set of prices.

The model is static, which does not provide insight into the economy’s dynamic adjustment process.REF Static models show the before and after of an economy when a shock is imposed.REF For example, in our experiment, the tariff removal is a shock that causes the reallocation of productive resources in more efficient ways.

In order to calculate the employment numbers, the GTAP database industries were mapped to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).REF There are 65 industriesREF in the GTAP databaseREF that were aggregated into six sectors: agriculture, extraction, textiles, light manufacturing, heavy manufacturing, and services. Once each GTAP industry was mapped to a NAICS sector, median salary data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics broken down by NAICS for 2014REF was matched with each GTAP industry. Then an average of salaries was taken to create averages for the six aggregated sectors. Finally, the output results from the CGE model were divided by the salaries of each aggregated sector to calculate the job gains and losses."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Heritage Foundation,https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/americans-do-not-need-more-steel-tariffs,Americans Do Not Need More Steel Tariffs,"Tori K. Smith, Former Jay Van Andel Senior Policy Analyst In Trade Policy, Smith Provided The Conservative True North On Free Trade Through Her Research",,"Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross transmitted a report to President Donald Trump on Oct. 22 that examines the effect that imports of specialized electrical steel have had on U.S. national security.

The report is the result of a request made in May by members of Congress and AK Steel, an American steelmaking company, to investigate whether the effect of these imports threaten national security. If so, the president would have authority to adjust steel imports via tariffs or other means under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.

Ross’ report has not been released to the public. However, we do know that it could recommend new tariffs on steel imports from nearly every country in the world. The administration has a history of imposing national security tariffs on steel imports, even on U.S. allies.

The current Section 232 investigation covered imported grain-oriented electrical steel, used primarily to create transformers for use in the broader electrical grid. The list of imports included “laminations for stacked cores for incorporation into transformers, stacked and wound cores for incorporation into transformers, electrical transformers, and transformer regulators.”

More than 85% of grain-oriented electrical steel is imported from Canada and Mexico. Today, the Office of the United States Trade Representative announced that Mexico would not be subject to Section 232 tariffs and would instead institute an export monitoring system for specialized electrical steel products.

While imports from Mexico seem to be safe for now from tariffs, we do not know if the Commerce Department’s report determined that these imports threatened U.S. national security or the fate of electrical steel imports from any other countries. The Trump administration has also used monitoring systems like this in the past to impose tariffs later; Canada just experienced this firsthand.

Existing national security tariffs on steel imports—including on some primary electrical steel—have not benefitted American families or the U.S. economy. After tariffs of 25% were imposed in March 2018, it is estimated that a few thousand steel jobs were created in the short term, but without tariffs they are not sustainable.

American families and businesses have paid $7.5 billion in extra steel tariffs since 2018, a cost that continues to grow each day.

At the same time, American businesses that use steel to produce other goods saw the price of imported steel and domestically produced steel go up. The price of domestic steel increased because the tariffs increased the cost of importing steel, so more importers looked to buy domestic.

However, the industry could not meet the drastic increase in demand, and so the prices skyrocketed.

The steel tariffs increased domestic steel prices by nearly 40% in the months immediately following the imposition of tariffs. Today, prices have stabilized to pre-tariff rates, as some countries and companies have received exemptions from the tariffs.

Businesses have also implemented cost-cutting measures, such as delaying capital investment plans and even reducing their number of employees.

For many businesses, the tariffs caused long-term damage. For example, Mid-Continent Nail, located in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, had to wait 10 months for an exemption from the 2018 steel tariffs. In the meantime, the company’s sales dropped by 60%, and it lost more than 200 employees.

AK Steel, which is owned by Cleveland-Cliffs, is the only U.S. company that produces the electrical steel that could face higher tariffs under this new investigation.

The company claims that the 2018 steel tariffs contained a loophole and that more tariffs are needed, otherwise it will “shut down the plants in Butler and Zanesville.” The 2018 tariffs made AK Steel’s intermediate steel products more expensive, whether it sourced domestically or internationally.

These tariffs also did nothing to make America safer. In fact, Defense Secretary James Mattis contested the 2018 report determining that steel imports threatened to impair U.S. national security.

Prior to 2018, Americans primarily imported steel from allies such as Canada, Japan, South Korea, and Germany. Furthermore, only 3% of U.S. steel production is used by the Department of Defense each year, and existing laws restrict the level of foreign content permitted for steel products procured by the Defense Department.

The 2018 steel tariffs did not help Americans. There is no reason to believe that tariffs on electrical steel will be any different. What we do know about tariffs is that they have an immense cost on American families and businesses.

Ron Harper, president of Cogent Power Inc., told Power Transformer News that new tariffs on grain-oriented electrical steel “has the potential to have a major cost impact on U.S. transformer manufacturers and utilities.”

In a recent letter to Ross, five members of Congress stated that tariffs on grain-oriented electrical steel would harm jobs in downstream industries, increase electricity prices, delay electrical grid upgrades, as well as make upgrades more costly.

The Trump administration should learn from its previous experience with steel tariffs and refrain from imposing new costs on American families and businesses. Instead, the administration should focus on advancing a pro-growth agenda that will help the economy recover from the pandemic slowdown."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Heritage Foundation,https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/congress-should-reauthorize-trade-programs-cut-tariffs-americans,Congress Should Reauthorize Trade Programs That Cut Tariffs for Americans,"Rachael Wilfong, Former Research Assistant, Energy, Climate, Rachael Was A Research Assistant In The Center For Energy, Environment At The Heritage Foundation.",,"Yesterday, members of the House of Representatives voted unanimously to reauthorize the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act. The act is a trade preference program that eliminates tariffs on organic chemicals and textiles, and was up for renewal by the end of September.

Although reauthorization of the program is a step in the right direction, Congress missed an opportunity to kill two birds with one stone by neglecting to link the renewal of the act with that of the Generalized System of Preferences.

The Generalized System of Preferences is a similar, larger program that eliminates taxes (i.e., tariffs) on more than 5,000 products. The program helps the United States and developing countries grow their economies and deepen trade relations, all while helping Americans save money.

Members of the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade originally proposed the idea to connect the two programs’ renewals during a hearing earlier this month.

Reps. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, and Vern Buchanan, R-Fla., sent a letter calling for this move and warned the committee that “a lapse of [either agreement] would be costly for U.S. manufacturers … In order to minimize uncertainty for U.S. companies and their partners in developing countries at this particularly vulnerable time, both programs should be renewed together.”

Just because members missed this chance to renew the Generalized System of Preferences now, does not mean they should stop pushing for its early reauthorization and extension. Despite numerous lapses, strong bipartisan support does exist for the program, especially when considering that the program saved Americans more than $1 billion in taxes in 2019 alone.

The program is set to expire on Dec. 31, and is typically renewed for a period of only two years. But a new Heritage Foundation report urges Congress to renew the program for at least 10 years, which would provide greater certainty and job security, and allow more individuals to benefit from the program.

The Coalition for GSP advocates for the program’s renewal and cites Kona Bicycle as an example of a company receiving those benefits. Kona, which provides biking equipment, was able to hire five workers and increase sales by more than $500,000 thanks to the 2018 renewal of the agreement.

The Generalized System of Preferences also is credited with encouraging innovation and allowing companies to improve benefits for employees. Officials with Summit Specialty International, which imports pine doors for home construction, said the preferences have enabled it to increase salaries for workers and provide health insurance for its entire staff.

It is stories such as these that inspired more than 250 businesses and associations to sign on to a letter urging Congress to renew the agreement. The letter echoes the concerns of Brady and Buchanan and goes a step further by pushing for the U.S. to reinstate India and Turkey as beneficiaries of the program.

The letter also encouraged the Trump administration to avoid terminating a portion of Thailand’s benefits, but approximately one-third of the country’s eligibility was removed in April 2020.

Matr Boomie, B&C Technologies, and Fab-Line Machinery, all signatories to the letter, import items almost exclusively from India, Thailand, or Turkey. In the past, the Generalized System of Preferences had allowed these companies to grow, hire employees, introduce new product lines, and increase wages and benefits for staff. But, with three of the largest beneficiaries losing their eligibility within the last year, these companies could suffer irreparable losses.

In June, United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer did comment that the U.S. and India were in discussions about potentially restoring India’s benefits, but no action has been taken yet.

Although the Generalized System of Preferences does not expire until the end of the year, renewing and extending the program sooner rather than later can spare Americans from another costly lapse.

Over the past four decades, the Generalized System of Preferences has saved Americans billions of dollars in taxes. It’s time for Congress to embrace it for the long term and prioritize its reauthorization."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Heritage Foundation,https://www.heritage.org/trade/commentary/get-ready-pay-more-goods-made-aluminum-thanks-new-tariffs,"Get Ready to Pay More for Goods Made With Aluminum, Thanks to New Tariffs","Tori K. Smith, Former Jay Van Andel Senior Policy Analyst In Trade Policy, Smith Provided The Conservative True North On Free Trade Through Her Research",,"Just weeks after the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement went into effect, President Donald Trump fired a shot across Canada's bow by reimposing 10% tariffs on certain primary aluminum imports.

These tariffs mean that the price of goods made from aluminum (tables, chairs, lamps, etc.) will go up for American families. The action is also a signal to American businesses that the administration will still impose new taxes on them—currently in the form of tariffs—despite the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic.

To understand why these new tariffs are being imposed, it helps to look back to when the Trump administration first began imposing tariffs on aluminum imports.

In 2018, an investigation by the Department of Commerce found that aluminum imports threatened to impair U.S. national security. President Trump then chose to impose tariffs of 10% on aluminum from all countries, even imports from our allies.

When tariffs were applied in March of that year, certain trading partners were given the opportunity to negotiate ""deals"" with the administration to avoid tariffs. Meanwhile, Americans were paying more for aluminum, and several countries implemented retaliatory tariffs. Canada hit $16.6 billion worth of products from the U.S. with tariffs, a move that had long-term negative impacts on U.S. exports of the targeted goods.

USMCA negotiations were ongoing as this tit-for-tat exchange took place, and Canada managed to receive an exemption from aluminum tariffs. In May 2019 an agreement was signed in which Canada agreed to an aluminum import monitoring system with the U.S. This meant that if the U.S. determined that aluminum imports from Canada ""increased substantially,"" they could reimpose tariffs.

So why have certain Canadian imports been hit with new 10% tariffs? Because the administration determined that they were major contributors to a 27% increase in aluminum imports from Canada between June 2019 and May 2020. This is not a measure of annual imports, but rather a snapshot of trade volumes mid-year.

The spike of aluminum imports from Canada is not nearly as extreme as the administration portrays. Americans will source roughly 14% of aluminum imports from their northern neighbor this year, only 2% above the average annual amount imported from Canada between 2015 and 2017.

The Trump administration's action of imposing aluminum tariffs on Canada is a major misstep.

First and foremost, the administration's new tariffs actually hurt the aluminum industry. The Aluminum Association—whose members produce roughly 70% of aluminum traded in North America—argue that the tariffs ""(make) U.S. aluminum companies less competitive when trying to sell their goods to industrial customers across North America.""

With tariffs on nearly every other country, a 2% increase in supply from one of the few countries with more competitively priced aluminum should be expected. The existing aluminum tariffs have already cost Americans $2.2 billion, and importers naturally want to avoid adding to that bill.

The increasing cost of aluminum tariffs will start growing faster now that some imports from Canada are subject to them. This could translate to even higher prices for everything from pickup trucks to canned fruits and vegetables.

Budgets are already tight for millions of Americans during the pandemic. Higher prices on the most basic goods hurt families, especially lower-income families that spend a larger portion of their income on food.

Canada is also set to retaliate with tariffs on an estimated $2.7 billion worth of U.S. products made from aluminum, including washers and bicycles. American businesses that export these products could see long-term damage to their ability to sell abroad as a result.

Refueling a trade dispute with Canada is not in the interest of American families or businesses. Tariffs on aluminum from Canada were damaging to American businesses in 2018 and could be even more harmful to the U.S. economy during the pandemic.

Rather than increasing the cost to trade with Canada—or any country—the Trump administration should be promoting pro-growth strategies, which include lowering tariffs."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Cato Institute,https://www.cato.org/blog/please-stop-calling-them-reciprocal-tariffs,Please Stop Calling them “Reciprocal” Tariffs,,2025-08-14,"Among President Trump’s many new (and unilateral) trade taxes—and by far the most sweeping—are his “reciprocal” tariffs, which today cover a large majority of all goods imported into the United States. As you may recall, Trump expressly sold the measures to the public in terms of “fairness”: US tariffs on goods from foreign countries would simply match the countries’ tariffs and nontariff barriers (NTBs) on American products. “No more, no less,” as Trump said in February when announcing the plan.

Hence, the term “reciprocal.”

Now that this tariff regime is generally in place (despite numerous Cato scholars advising against it), we can assess whether these new import taxes live up to their name—at least when it comes to other countries’ tariffs on US exports. (Assessing the NTB claim is impossible because the administration never comprehensively quantified countries’ NTBs; regardless, the administration’s original—and not credible—reciprocal tariff formula, supposedly incorporating NTBs, has been discarded.)

You may be (but since you’re reading this, probably aren’t) surprised to learn that there’s nothing “reciprocal” about these “reciprocal tariffs.” In fact, the Trump administration’s new tariff regime,

Only once matches new US tariffs to other countries’ tariffs (and rarely even gets close to such a match);

In the vast majority of cases—and for all major US import sources and free trade agreement (FTA) partners—sets US tariffs at rates much higher than those foreign governments apply to American goods; and

Whether intentionally or not, actually tends to impose higher tariffs on countries with lower tariffs on US exports.

Make it make sense.

Let’s start with the last point first. Figure 1 plots the country-specific “reciprocal” tariffs imposed by President Trump last week and the most recent World Trade Organization data on those same countries’ tariffs on US goods. (Roll over each dot to see a country’s tariff in both instances.) A truly “reciprocal” tariff regime would show these two numbers to match (or, at least, be roughly in the same ballpark). Thus, a US reciprocal rate of, say, 10 percent would mirror a government’s 10 percent average tariff rate on US exports, and we’d see a trendline moving up and to the right in the chart. Instead, we see no such relationship and, in fact, the opposite trend: reciprocal rates, especially those for countries singled out by the US for a special (not “baseline”) tariff, tend to be higher for countries that charge lower tariffs on US exports.

A widely reported example is that of Switzerland, which, despite levying a trade-weighted average applied most-favored nation (MFN) tariff of 0.2 percent on US exports, now has its exports subject to a whopping 39 percent US “reciprocal” tariff. Other countries with low tariffs on US exports, such as the EU (1.7 percent), New Zealand (1.5), Indonesia (4), Vietnam (2.9), and even India (6.2), got hit with comparatively high US duties (15 percent, 15 percent, 19 percent, 20 percent, and 25 percent, respectively). The 10 percent baseline tariff has a similar asymmetry for developed countries, even ones with zero (e.g., Singapore) or near-zero tariffs (the UK at 0.9 percent) on US goods. (Many poor nations have high tariffs because it’s the only way they can raise revenue.)

Overall, Figure 2 shows that about 80 percent of the US “reciprocal” tariff rates—as applied to 144 foreign countries for which the WTO reports tariff data—are higher than those countries’ average tariffs on US exports. The situation is even more unbalanced for the biggest US import suppliers: for all of the top 25 countries from which the United States imported goods in 2024 (excluding Canada and Mexico, as they do not have “reciprocal” rates), the “reciprocal” tariff rates are higher than these countries’ tariffs on US exports—and the former exceeds the latter by almost 12.5 percentage points on average (Figure 3).

Importantly, these figures do not address the fact that multiple countries have signed FTAs with the United States, eliminating most tariff and nontariff barriers and thus applying even lower tariffs to to US exports than the already-low “MFN” rates listed for these countries above. As Table 1 shows, these agreements—which, unlike Trump’s tariff “deals,” are legally binding and have been approved by Congress—offered partner countries little refuge from “reciprocal” tariffs, which are on average 11.5 percentage points higher than the preferential rate these governments give US products. Unfortunately, President Trump’s unilateral actions have obliterated the real reciprocity these governments thought they were getting when signing these agreements.

In sum, the US “reciprocal” tariff regime is nothing of the sort, with new US tariffs in most cases (and in all important ones) far exceeding the average tariffs that foreign governments apply to American goods. This revelation is more than just a rhetorical gotcha: tariff advocates, including Trump himself, have long justified new US tariffs on the grounds that they were needed to balance foreign tariffs, which are supposedly quite high, on American goods. The data above reveal this justification to be empty—especially since the “reciprocal” tariffs in almost all cases apply (“stack”) on top of existing US tariffs, which in many important instances (e.g., pickup trucks and shoes) are themselves substantial.

Overall, the data further demonstrate that US tariffs today are about protectionism, with “fairness” and other buzzwords simply a cover for achieving it."
tariffs,Think Tanks,Cato Institute,https://www.cato.org/blog/no-tariffs-are-not-similar-consumption-taxes-vat,"No, Tariffs Are Not Similar to Consumption Taxes Like a VAT",,2025-08-01,"Some tariff supporters have tried to rebrand tariffs as nothing more than a consumption tax, arguing they’re just like the value-added taxes (VATs) that many other countries use. See, for example, here and here. The implication buried in these claims is that because other countries use VATs, they should be offset by US tariffs—and that any such tariffs would be a common way to raise government revenue just like VATs are.

This argument might sound good at first blush, but it’s wrong. Tariffs differ from a consumption tax, VAT, or other similar tax in both form and effect.

A VAT is a broad-based consumption tax applied at each stage of production and consisting of three essential components. First, it is border-adjusted. Exported goods are exempt, often through a border rebate, and imported goods face the same VAT rate as domestic goods, making it a tax on consumption, not on trade. Second, it’s transparent. The full VAT tax amount generally appears on receipts for goods and services. Third, the tax applies only to value added by the producer at the stage of production and not to the total value of the good. The tax still causes distortions, but the value-added design minimizes incentives for creative accounting and avoidance schemes.

Tariffs have none of these features.

The economic effects of tariffs and consumption taxes also differ. The direct effect of a consumption tax is to reduce how much you buy. This is true for a VAT or a 6 percent sales tax. That missing consumption is foregone economic activity not fully compensated by tax revenue. Economists refer to this as a deadweight loss. The consumption taxes we pay regularly don’t discriminate by the origin of the good. If you are buying a Tesla Model Y, you will pay the same sales tax rate whether final assembly was in California or Texas.[i]

Tariffs, on the other hand, are taxes only on imports. They raise the price of foreign goods relative to domestic goods, which means they distort consumers’ choices. Tariffs are also not very transparent, as the final consumer is rarely the importer of record. But at least some, if not all, of the tariffs paid on aircraft, steel, and avocados are likely to be passed along and recouped on the final bill of sale.

Let’s consider avocados produced in Mexico (about 80 percent of US avocado imports) or California (about 90 percent of US domestic production). Initially, suppose the price of a Haas avocado is $1, and then we put tariffs of 25 percent on Mexican goods. Imported avocado prices rise, possibly up to $1.25. This will shift some US consumption over to Californian avocados, where farmers will be happy to produce more at the new, higher price.

By raising the price of avocados, the tariff has an effect like a consumption tax because people buy less. The losses include foregone avocado consumption in terms of less avocado toast or substituting more vegetables and other fillers like green peas into our guacamole recipes (yuck!).

But this is where the consumption tax comparison is not enough. Profit-maximizing California avocado farmers might be induced to increase water usage and fertilizers to boost yields. They will devote land to avocado farming that could be used for other crops (e.g., oranges, lemons, olives, etc.) or purposes (e.g., housing). Shifting toward more domestic avocado output with higher production costs at the expense of other productive economic activities reduces overall economic efficiency.

More generally, this reallocation away from imports and toward domestic producers is thus a costly production distortion. Some will argue that favoring domestic over foreign goods through tariffs is a good thing. But more domestic production, jobs, or higher wages in the sectors with tariff protection cannot be conjured from thin air. To get more domestic avocados, steel, or autos, we must reallocate workers, capital, and land away from other uses.

The production distortions from tariffs can be large and are often in plain sight. An unfortunate recent example is Delta Air Lines’ decision to strip off the US-made engines from Airbus passenger jets made in Europe, import the engines separately, and then install them on its US Airbus fleet, all to avoid tariffs. In another famous example, Ford installed extra rows of seats on its foreign-made Transit cargo vans. When the vehicles arrived stateside, Ford paid a lower tariff rate by classifying them as passenger vans. Ford then ripped out and recycled the seats.

It’s likely thousands of costly and inefficient decisions are being made by US firms up and down their supply chain to adapt to the changing tariff landscape over the first half of 2025. Moreover, none of these costly contortions would be necessary under a VAT, which taxes imports and domestic products equally.

Could a tariff ever be just like a consumption tax that is immune to the many distortions that typically accompany tariffs? I can imagine a special case, but it unravels when examined closely. Suppose there is a unique product solely sourced from one country. Then, an import tariff would increase the cost to buy that good, there would be no domestic production to distort, and it would have an effect similar to a consumption tax.

Not only are examples like this rare (e.g., Himalayan sea salt), but many distortions could arise anyway. As soon as you tariff Himalayan sea salt, for example, consumption is distorted toward other similar but less desirable salt varieties. Smuggling operations and transshipment schemes might pop up. Even a seemingly clever tariff policy trying to exploit this idea can easily backfire. The US tried to target specific Japanese motorcycle models by engine size in the 1980s. But that means companies innovate and specialize around the arbitrary characteristics. And thus, we are right back where we started with a host of inefficiencies and distortions, even though we started out seeking to minimize these losses.

So why the misleading comparison? The VAT line gives cover to protectionism under the guise of “fairness.” If you can convince the public that other countries are taxing us and we’re not taxing them, then tariffs look like a justifiable policy correction. But the economics are clear: VAT is not a tariff, and tariffs are not a consumption tax.

As the examples above show, US and foreign businesses will see right through the wordplay and respond accordingly. If you’re designing trade policy based on a false analogy, don’t be surprised when the results are exactly what economists predicted: higher costs, less trade, and a reduction in global competitiveness."

This comes just a couple of weeks after the Trump administration also revoked the US visas of Moraes, his family, and his allies on the court, barring them from entering the United States. Under the direction of Moraes, the Brazilian judiciary has taken increasingly authoritarian actions to cement its power and crack down on dissent. It has

seized powers to punish its political adversaries, both on the left and the right, in the name of protecting democracy;

ordered US social media companies to censor Brazilian and American speech with secret orders;

arrested individuals with no due process or charges, and raided the homes or seized the property of individuals for expressing non-violent ideas; and

overturned legal protections for platforms that carry online speech on little more than a whim after the legislature recently ruled out changes so that the court can police online speech as it deems appropriate.

The Trump administration is right that Justice Moraes and his allies are to blame for infringing on the rights and liberties of Brazilians and Americans.

But at the same time, Trump has also imposed 50 percent tariffs on many Brazilian exports as part of his quarrel with the Brazilian government. A 50 percent tariff is only adding yet another tax that Americans must pay for various goods they want to buy from Brazil. Most notably, Brazil accounts for about a third of America’s imports of unroasted coffee and is the number one producer of sugar in the world. And these tariffs also harm the average Brazilian working in these industries, the very Brazilians living under the arbitrary and speech-stifling rules set by the Supreme Court. As opposed to just targeting censorious, rights-abusing leaders, using broad tariffs hurts everyone but Moraes and his cronies.

Furthermore, the Trump administration’s justification for taking action would also be far more principled and persuasive if it were more consistent on free speech at home. Trying to deport immigrants for writing an op-ed with views the administration doesn’t like regarding Gaza, having the FCC openly pressuring major news companies to change their editorial positions under threat of government punishment, and more all weaken America’s ability to be the free speech champion that it should and can be."

President Donald Trump is facing some backlash from on his plan to allow 600,000 student visas for Chinese nationals to be issued, including Hudson Institute senior fellow Michael Sobolik.
President Donald Trump’s America First trade agenda is working, and China is feeling the heat.  
While the legacy media has spent months lying about slow growth, Trump’s tariff agenda is already reshaping how the U.S. competes with China — and America’s industrial and agricultural sectors are benefiting as a result. New tariff protections are prompting the reshoring of critical production and strengthening the U.S. economy. 
The president has so far sent a clear message: the days of America propping up Beijing’s rise are over. Thanks to Trump’s leadership, we’re finally winning again. U.S. manufacturing is rebounding, investment is flowing into strategic industries and American farmers are getting the protection they need from unfair Chinese competition and emerging bio-threats.  
TRUMP LEARNS A LESSON GROUNDED IN FAITH, HOW BEST TO STAND TOUGH ON TRADE WITH CHINA
For years, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has targeted the foundations of our economy, hollowed out our manufacturing sector, cheated our farmers and manipulated global markets with impunity.

Under the Biden administration, Washington operated on the belief that economic engagement with China would bring reform and stability. That bet never paid off. Instead, we've seen mass intellectual property theft, industrial manipulation, and an alarming pattern of biosecurity breaches that could seriously harm American agriculture and our food supply. 
U.S. federal prosecutors recently revealed that a fungus called ""Fusarium graminearum"" was illegally trafficked into the country by individuals connected to CCP-aligned research institutions. This fungus is a well-known biological agent that renders crops inedible, threatens livestock and causes reproductive damage to humans and livestock. This wasn't a minor violation or mistake; it was a coordinated effort to smuggle a dangerous agricultural pathogen onto U.S. soil to wreak havoc on our food supply chain and public health. 
TRUMP IS TAKING THE FIGHT TO THE CCP. IT'S LONG PAST TIME WE PROTECTED OUR BASES AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE
Those involved included two Chinese nationals who were tied to American research institutions. The potential consequences of their actions were anything but small — as American farms and food systems could have suffered widespread contamination, economic loss, and long-term damage. 
Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated episode. Just last year, five Chinese nationals were caught surveilling a U.S. military site in Michigan. Additionally, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that in recent years, numerous Chinese college-age individuals have been caught taking photos of vital defense sites in the U.S. Taken together, these incidents point to something bigger than isolated wrongdoing. They suggest an ongoing strategy aimed, originating in Beijing, at weakening key sectors of the American economy from the inside out. 
This is why America must protect our supply chain and produce our most crucial farm inputs here at home. In a recent poll by the Protecting America Initiative, 71% of Americans said they would like to see our farm inputs, like pesticides, produced domestically instead of relying on imports from China. 
So, what are we doing to combat this growing and very serious threat? 
BROOKE ROLLINS: FARM SECURITY IS NATIONAL SECURITY
Thankfully, we have a leader who is taking this challenge seriously. Trump’s policies have reshaped how the United States deals with China and the results are starting to show.

When Europe was flooding our markets and ripping off the U.S. with unfair trade deals, Trump didn’t hesitate; he hit back with tariffs. For the first time in years, the EU stopped treating American markets like a dumping ground. They came to the table, and American industries got breathing room. 
Now, Trump is using that same proven strategy to take on the CCP. He is restoring balance to a relationship that for too long has tilted in China’s favor. 
CHINESE BIOWEAPON SMUGGLING CASE SHOWS US 'TRAINS OUR ENEMIES,' 'LEARNED NOTHING' FROM COVID: SECURITY EXPERT
China, like the European Union before it, is learning that the days of taking advantage of the American economy are coming to an end. When these deals are finalized, both Beijing and Brussels will be operating on terms that respect U.S. workers, innovation and strength.

The path to a stronger America runs through tough trade enforcement, and President Trump is the one who is leading us there.

That chapter has closed.

President Donald Trump’s bold move to impose a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and key auto parts signals a major shift, one that the United Auto Workers union is calling a victory for American laborers.

UAW President Shawn Fain, once a Trump critic and Harris supporter, put it plainly: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”

For too long, automakers have chased after cheap foreign labor, shuttering American plants as they rake in record profits. These tariffs send a clear message: If you want to sell in the world’s most lucrative auto market, you must build in America — and hire American workers.

At the heart of the UAW’s shift is its recognition that Trump’s revised auto tariffs will benefit American workers and reinvigorate domestic manufacturing. The swift impact of these tariffs will be felt in plants that have long sat idle or been completely shuttered.

Consider Michigan’s Warren Truck Assembly Plant, where over 1,000 workers were laid off while Stellantis continued to produce high-end trucks in Mexico — paying workers there as little as $3 an hour. Or look at Volkswagen’s Chattanooga facility, where the company slashed American labor hours during contract negotiations, even as 75% of its North American production continued unabated in Mexico. With these tariffs in place, automakers have been given a simple choice: bring jobs back to U.S. soil or lose access to the world’s most valuable auto market.

Beyond reviving existing plants, these tariffs could breathe new life into once-thriving factories such as Ohio’s Lordstown Assembly, which employed thousands of workers before it was gutted by free trade deals. Belvidere Assembly, another casualty of offshoring, is slated to reopen, but with only a fraction of its former workforce. With strong trade protections in place, these facilities could see a full resurgence, restoring thousands of jobs to communities that need them desperately.

Auto manufacturers have already begun to respond to Trump’s auto tariffs. General Motors is ramping up production and hiring in Indiana, while Ford Motor Company is launching a “From America, For America” campaign offering employee pricing to consumers.

This isn’t just about economics — it’s also a matter of national security. Decades of dependence on foreign manufacturing have destroyed America’s industrial base and left our supply chains vulnerable, as the COVID-19 pandemic made painfully clear. Trump’s tariffs are a crucial step toward restoring American industrial strength and ensuring we can sustain domestic auto production when it matters most.

The numbers paint a troubling picture. In 1985, American-owned auto plants produced 97% of the cars sold in the United States. Today, half of the 16 million vehicles purchased in the U.S. are imported, and the domestic content of so-called American-made cars has plummeted to just 25%. Meanwhile, the U.S. trade deficit in auto parts has ballooned to $93.5 billion. These tariffs aim to reverse these troubling trends by bolstering domestic manufacturing and reducing America’s dependence on foreign-made vehicles and parts.

Another challenge for both the White House and UAW leadership is addressing deeply flawed trade deals such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. These agreements have failed to prevent job offshoring and have done little to address national security risks posed by auto imports.

TRUMP THREATENS ADDITIONAL 50% TARIFF ON CHINA

For decades, policymakers have made empty promises, allowing corporations to decimate thriving American industrial towns in pursuit of cheap labor. Now, Trump’s auto tariffs offer a long-overdue course correction, one that prioritizes American jobs and working-class dignity over corporate profits. Automakers have spent years reaping the rewards of weak trade policies; they must now bear the costs of these tariffs, rather than shifting them onto consumers.

Corporations have been sent an unmistakable message: If you want to sell cars in America, build them in America. And for the American autoworker, the message is one of hope: Help has arrived at last.

tariffs,Think Tanks,America First Policy Institute,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/op-ed-jonathan-shell-and-tate-bennett,Op-Ed: Jonathan Shell and Tate Bennett: President Trump’s Trade Wins Are a Boon for American Agriculture,The Washington Reporter,,"In an era when rural America has too often been left behind by globalization, President Donald J. Trump’s recent trade deals are delivering long-overdue wins for the backbone of our nation: American farmers. His administration’s actions mark meaningful efforts to neutralize our growing agricultural trade deficit. With bold new policies and a renewed emphasis on fairness, President Trump is proving that agricultural producers are not just part of our economy, they are a top priority.

On April 2, 2025, President Trump announced his signature “Liberation Day” tariffs, which introduced a universal 10 percent baseline tariff on imports. This shift has leveled the playing field for American producers, long burdened by bad trade deals. For decades, foreign countries imposed steep tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods while flooding our markets with subsidized produce, meat, and grain. That is no longer the case.

Under President Trump’s leadership, countries that wish to access the lucrative American consumer base must now eliminate their unfair barriers to U.S. agriculture. This includes long-overdue reforms from key trading partners who have discriminated against our beef, pork, soybeans, and corn.

One of the most notable outcomes of late is the recent U.S. trade agreement with the United Kingdom and China’s removal of its Liberation Day retaliatory tariffs, and nowhere are the benefits of these trade deals more evident than in the field.

With Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins by his side, President Trump announced a historic trade deal, providing American companies unprecedented access to the U.K. market while bolstering U.S. national security. The U.K. agreement is a step toward leveling the playing field for U.S. dairy and wheat, and it is a win for farmers across the Heartland. This provides a much-needed diversification of export destinations for producers facing rising costs and uncertain global demand. The deal is great for corn farmers too. The U.K. will offer a preferential duty-free quota of 1.4 billion liters for U.S. ethanol. Moreover, the U.K. will remove the 20 percent tariff and establish a duty-free quota of 13,000 metric tons for U.S. beef, a historic opening of a new market for American cattle farmers and ranchers. Secretary Rollins embarked on a trade delegation visit to the U.K. following the announcement, where she emphasized the importance of eliminating non-tariff barriers, too, such as those related to differing regulatory frameworks.

China’s will also eliminate its tariffs on American commodities as well. After recognizing their reliance on American farmers, Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural imports, as high as 125 percent after Liberation Day, have now fallen to 10 percent for the next 90 days, just in time for planting season.

The Trump administration’s trade strategy is not only about immediate economic gains, it is about protecting the future of American farming and enhancing prosperity in rural America. By demanding reciprocal treatment and defending the value of American produce on the world stage, President Trump is ensuring that farming remains a viable, profitable, and respected profession for generations to come.

These trade deals are part of a broader vision to restore American economic dominance. By holding trading partners accountable and ensuring that trade is fair and reciprocal, this administration is laying the groundwork for sustained economic growth and job creation. President Trump’s fight for fair trade is more than just renegotiated deals. They are a testament to his commitment to putting America first, always. In putting American workers and growers first, President Trump is reaffirming that a strong nation begins with strong farms.

President Trump’s policies are empowering American workers, strengthening national security, and positioning the United States as a leader in the global economy. By challenging unfair trade practices and securing favorable terms for American industries, he is ensuring that the United States remains a strong and competitive force on the world stage.

tariffs,Think Tanks,America First Policy Institute,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/04/08/opinion-implement-fair-trade-to-protect-american-security/,Opinion: Implement fair trade to protect American security,Mike Garcia,2025-04-08,"This commentary is a counterpoint to an op-ed from Rep. Scott Peters. Both were published in print April 8.

In a utopian world, our nation would operate in free markets, with secure borders and no fear of foreign regimes robbing, replicating and replacing American-made goods. Alas, this is not a perfect world, especially in California, where weak politicians have left people, markets and communities vulnerable. For too long, our leaders have accepted the status quo, embracing imbalanced trade policies and open borders threatening our safety and economic prosperity.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs are a key step in ensuring fairness in trade and putting the American people first in their own markets.

Trump’s “Liberation Day” trade announcements mark a strong opening for negotiations, and it should be noted that the United States’ new discounted tariff rates remain far lower than what many countries charge us. Our eroding manufacturing base threatens national security as billions in trade deficits pile up. Trump is right — addressing these unfair practices will revive manufacturing, protect national security and restore good wages for the American worker.

Trump and his economic team understand that economics and national security go hand in hand. Without holding China, Mexico and Canada accountable for the deadly flow of illegal fentanyl, cartels will continue trafficking it across our border, killing tens of thousands of Americans each year.

Just 1 kilogram of fentanyl can kill 500,000 people. In 2023, a record 62,224 pounds of fentanyl was seized in California — about 28,224.33 kilograms, enough to kill the entire global population twice over, or every American nearly 41 times. Tariffs send a clear message: If you threaten our national security, you will face economic repercussions.

The White House acknowledges that Mexico has become a haven for criminal cartels, enabling deadly fentanyl from China to flow into the United States. The Chinese Communist Party not only allows this fentanyl production but also floods our market with counterfeit goods and steals American innovation.

We have yet to see Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum present permanent solutions. Trump’s tariffs provide leverage to counter Mexico’s state-cartel nexus.

The illicit drug supply chain doesn’t end with China and Mexico. Canada has also emerged as a player in this crisis, with a growing number of fentanyl synthesis labs. That’s why Trump’s tariff package places a 25% tariff on most goods and a 10% tariff on Canada’s energy exports to the United States.

Trump’s reciprocal tariffs align with his philosophy of fairness in economic competition. IfChina forces American businesses to cede 50.1% of their soil and ownership, we must do the same. If China demands access to U.S. data, we must demand access to theirs. Given China’s theft of American innovation, safeguards and reciprocal measures are not just warranted — they’re essential.

Some Americans may find these tariffs uncomfortable, but we must remember that the U.S. has one of the world’s most open economies — access to our market is a privilege, not a guarantee. To get Canada, Mexico and China to cooperate, we must prioritize American interests. It is the duty of our political leaders to use every tool at their disposal to achieve the policy goals that Americans voted for.

Tariffs may bring short-term consequences, such as financial uncertainty, but the long-termbenefits are already evident. Mexico and Canada have already made foreign policy concessions, and companies like Apple, Hyundai, Volvo, Honda and Isuzu have announced plans to move production back to the United States.

Policy proposals often overlook the simple truth that “the enemy gets a vote.” This doesn’tnecessarily means any nation is an enemy, but it acknowledges the reality that outside forces have an impact on our policies. In our imperfect world, we should be grateful for a strong leader who realizes tariffs may be a necessary policy tool for accountability, security and prosperity.

A few months ago, he laid off one of the company’s seven workers, an embroiderer. During a bad stretch when orders were low and cash flow dwindled, he asked his bank to extend a line of credit so he could keep paying the bills.

He has lifted prices on garments and other items, but he is wary of imposing additional costs because he does not want to further depress demand.

“It’s difficult to have to survive because of poor policy,” Mr. Mills said.

Jerome H. Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, hinted this month at the challenges that small businesses face, saying after the central bank lowered interest rates that “companies that sit between the exporter and the consumer” are bearing the brunt of the tariffs.

“If you buy something and you sell it through retail, or you use it to make a product, you’re probably taking a lot of those costs on and not able to pass it fully along to the consumer yet,” Mr. Powell said. “All of those companies and entities in the middle, they’ll tell you that they have every intention of passing that through in time, but they’re not doing that now.”

According to a recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, 86 percent of companies in the United States that import goods by sea, the most common means of international trade, have fewer than 50 employees. But unlike bigger companies with diverse supply chains, smaller firms typically import goods from one supplier and one country, it found."

Those plans appear to have paid off. Mr. Trump’s announcement on Thursday of 100 percent tariffs on brand-name drugs imported to the United States contained a carve out for drugmakers that were already building new factories in the country.

Although some European officials and companies appeared confident on Friday that existing trade agreements and investments would shield them from this exceedingly high tariff rate, others were cautiously awaiting further details. As with many aspects of Mr. Trump’s turbulent trade policy, key information on how the new levies would be put in place has not yet been revealed.

Still, the pharmaceutical companies and their investors believe that Mr. Trump’s tariff announcement will potentially have little effect on them."

As the source of about 40 percent of goods imported into the United States, Asia has borne the brunt of Mr. Trump’s campaign to rewrite the rules of global trade. Trade officials across the region have scrambled to strike deals with his administration over the last several months to prevent punishing tariffs from crippling domestic industries.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump announced another round of tariffs, which would go into effect on Oct. 1, applying import duties ranging from 25 percent to 100 percent on pharmaceuticals, heavy trucks, kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture. A significant portion of furniture and kitchen cabinet manufacturing originates from China and Southeast Asia.

The effects of the new tariffs are likely to be felt across sectors of the economy, from housing and health care to logistics. The tariffs range from 25 percent to 100 percent, with the highest levies applying to “any branded or patented” pharmaceutical product coming into the United States.

The president also said the United States would begin imposing a 50 percent tariff on imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and associated products, along with a 30 percent tariff on imported upholstered furniture and a 25 percent tariff on foreign semi trucks.

The prospect of tariffs on foreign-made pharmaceuticals had spurred fears of higher drug prices and shortages of critical medicines.

Tariff cuts

Developed countries tariff cuts were for the most part phased in over five years from 1 January 1995. The result is a 40% cut in their tariffs on industrial products, from an average of 6.3% to 3.8%. The value of imported industrial products that receive duty-free treatment in developed countries will jump from 20% to 44%.

There will also be fewer products charged high duty rates. The proportion of imports into developed countries from all sources facing tariffs rates of more than 15% will decline from 7% to 5%. The proportion of developing country exports facing tariffs above 15% in industrial countries will fall from 9% to 5%.

The Uruguay Round package has been improved. On 26 March 1997, 40 countries accounting for more than 92% of world trade in information technology products, agreed to eliminate import duties and other charges on these products by 2000 (by 2005 in a handful of cases). As with other tariff commitments, each participating country is applying its commitments equally to exports from all WTO members (i.e. on a most-favoured-nation basis), even from members that did not make commitments.

More bindings

Developed countries increased the number of imports whose tariff rates are bound (committed and difficult to increase) from 78% of product lines to 99%. For developing countries, the increase was considerable: from 21% to 73%. Economies in transition from central planning increased their bindings from 73% to 98%. This all means a substantially higher degree of market security for traders and investors.

> more on market access

> See also Doha Agenda negotiations

And agriculture ...

Tariffs on all agricultural products are now bound. Almost all import restrictions that did not take the form of tariffs, such as quotas, have been converted to tariffs  a process known as tariffication. This has made markets substantially more predictable for agriculture. Previously more than 30% of agricultural produce had faced quotas or import restrictions. The first step in tariffication was to replace these restrictions with tariffs that represented about the same level of protection. Then, over six years from 1995-2000, these tariffs were gradually reduced (the reduction period for developing countries ends in 2005). The market access commitments on agriculture also eliminate previous import bans on certain products.

In addition, the lists include countries commitments to reduce domestic support and export subsidies for agricultural products. (See section on agriculture.)"
tariffs,Reports,World Trade Organization (WTO),https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/agric_e/ag_intro02_access_e.htm#conceptual,Agriculture - explanation of the agreement - market access,,,"The conceptual framework

On the market access side, the Uruguay Round resulted in a key systemic change: the switch from a situation where a myriad of non-tariff measures impeded agricultural trade flows to a regime of bound tariff-only protection plus reduction commitments. The key aspects of this fundamental change have been to stimulate investment, production and trade in agriculture by (i) making agricultural market access conditions more transparent, predictable and competitive, (ii) establishing or strengthening the link between national and international agricultural markets, and thus (iii) relying more prominently on the market for guiding scarce resources into their most productive uses both within the agricultural sector and economy-wide.

In many cases, tariffs were the only form of protection for agricultural products before the Uruguay Round  the Round led to the binding in the WTO of a maximum level for these tariffs. For many other products, however, market access restrictions involved non-tariff barriers. This was frequently, though not only, the case for major temperate zone agricultural products. The Uruguay Round negotiations aimed to remove such barriers. For this purpose, a tariffication package was agreed which, amongst other things, provided for the replacement of agriculture-specific non-tariff measures with a tariff which afforded an equivalent level of protection. The tariffs resulting from the tariffication process account, on average of the developed country Members, for around one fifth of the total number of agricultural tariff lines. For the developing country Members, this share is considerably smaller. Following the entry into force of the Agreement on Agriculture, there is now a prohibition on agriculture-specific non-tariff measures, and the tariffs on virtually all agricultural products traded internationally are bound in the WTO.

Schedule of tariff concessions

Each WTO Member has a schedule of tariff concessions covering all agricultural products. These concessions are an integral part of the results of the Uruguay Round, are formally annexed to the Marrakesh Protocol [cross-reference] and have become an integral part of the GATT 1994 [cross-reference]. The schedule sets out for each individual agricultural product, or, in some cases agricultural products defined more generally, the maximum tariff that can be applied on imports into the territory of the Member concerned. The tariffs in the schedules include those that resulted from the tariffication process, which, in many cases, are considerably higher than industrial tariffs, reflecting the incidence of agriculture-specific non-tariff measures prior to the WTO. Many developing countries have bound their previously unbound tariffs at ceiling levels, i.e. at levels higher than the applied rates prior to the WTO.

Developed country Members have agreed to reduce, over a six-year period beginning in 1995, their tariffs by 36 per cent on average of all agricultural products, with a minimum cut of 15 per cent for any product. For developing countries, the cuts are 24 and 10 per cent, respectively, to be implemented over ten years. Those developing country Members which bound tariffs at ceiling levels did not, in many cases, undertake reduction commitments. Least-developed country Members were required to bind all agricultural tariffs, but not to undertake tariff reductions.

... and tariff quota commitments

As part of the tariffication package, WTO Members were required to maintain, for tariffied products, current import access opportunities at levels corresponding to those existing during the 1986-88 base period. Where such current access had been less than 5 per cent of domestic consumption of the product in question in the base period, an (additional) minimum access opportunity had to be opened on a most-favoured-nation basis. This was to ensure that in 1995, current and minimum access opportunities combined represented at least 3 per cent of base-period consumption and are progressively expanded to reach 5 per cent of that consumption in the year 2000 (developed country Members) or 2004 (developing country Members), respectively.

The current and minimum access opportunities are generally implemented in the form of tariff quotas. In case of minimum access, the applicable duty was required to be low or minimal, low that is either in absolute terms or, at least, in relation to the normal ordinary customs duty that applies to any imports outside the tariff quota. These tariff quotas, including the applicable tariff rates and any other conditions related to the tariff quotas, are specified in the schedules of the WTO Members concerned.

While the vast majority of tariff quotas in agriculture have their origin in the Uruguay Round negotiations, a number of such commitments were the result of accessions to the WTO. Currently (July 1999), 37 Members have tariff quotas specified in their schedules. In total, there are 1374 individual tariff quotas. These tariff quotas constitute binding commitments as opposed to autonomous tariff quotas which Members may establish at any time, for example, in order to stabilize the domestic price after a poor harvest.

The prohibition of non-tariff border measures

Article 4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture prohibits the use of agriculture-specific non-tariff measures. Such measures include quantitative import restrictions, variable import levies, minimum import prices, discretionary import licensing procedures, voluntary export restraint agreements and non-tariff measures maintained through state-trading enterprises. All similar border measures other than normal customs duties are also no longer permitted. Although Article XI:2(c) of the GATT [cross-reference] continues to permit non-tariff import restrictions on fisheries products, it is now inoperative as regards agricultural products because it is superseded by the Agreement on Agriculture.

However, Article 4.2 of the Agreement on Agriculture does not prevent the use of non-tariff import restrictions consistent with the provisions of the GATT or other WTO agreements which are applicable to traded goods generally (industrial or agricultural). Such measures include those maintained under balance-of-payments provisions (Articles XII and XVIII of GATT), general safeguard provisions (Article XIX of GATT and the related WTO agreement), general exceptions (Article XX of GATT), the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade or other general, non-agriculture-specific WTO provisions.

Special treatment

The Agreement on Agriculture contains a special treatment clause (Annex 5), under which four countries were permitted, subject to strictly circumscribed conditions, to maintain non-tariff border measures on certain products during the period of tariff reductions (with the possibility of extending the special treatment, subject to further negotiations). As one of the conditions, market access in the form of progressively increasing import quotas has to be provided for the products concerned. The products and countries concerned are: rice in the case of Japan, Korea and the Philippines; and cheese and sheepmeat in the case of Israel. As of 1 April 1999, Japan has ceased to apply special treatment.

The special safeguard provisions

As a third element of the tariffication package, Members have the right to invoke for tariffied products the special safeguard provisions of the Agreement on Agriculture (Article 5), provided that a reservation to this effect (SSG) appears beside the products concerned in the relevant Members schedule. The right to make use of the special safeguard provisions has been reserved by 38 Members, and for a limited number of products in each case.

The special safeguard provisions allow the imposition of an additional tariff where certain criteria are met. The criteria involve either a specified surge in imports (volume trigger), or, on a shipment by shipment basis, a fall of the import price below a specified reference price (price trigger). In case of the volume trigger, the higher duties only apply until the end of the year in question. In case of the price trigger, any additional duty can only be imposed on the shipment concerned. The additional duties cannot be applied to imports taking place within tariff quotas.

Notification obligations

The bound agricultural tariffs and the tariff quota commitments are contained in Members schedules. There is no requirement for Members to notify their tariffs to the Committee on Agriculture. Applied tariffs are, however, to be submitted to other bodies of the WTO, including the Committee on Market Access and in the context of the Trade Policy Review mechanism.

Members with tariff quotas and the right to use the special safeguard provisions are required to make both ad hoc and annual notifications to the Committee on Agriculture. At the beginning of the implementation period, an up-front notification was due, setting out how each tariff quota is to be administered. Such notifications disclose, for example, if imports are permitted on a first-come-first-served basis or if import licences are used  and in the latter case, an indication of who is able to obtain a licence and how they are allocated. An ad hoc notification is required if the method of allocation under any tariff quota changes. At the end of each year, a notification of the quantity of imports entering under each tariff quota is required (tariff quota fill).

Members with the right to use the special safeguard provisions must notify its first use in order to allow its trading partners to establish the parameters of the special safeguard action, such as the volume or price used to trigger the special safeguard action. In the case of the price trigger, an upfront notification of the relevant reference prices has also been possible. In addition, an annual summary notification of the use of the special safeguard is required.

Work is ongoing to update and complete the information in the Integrated Data Base (IDB).

Non-Tariff Barriers

As first step, Members have agreed to identify difficulties encountered by their exporters when exporting to various markets. Discussions will be pursued on the scope of NTBs to be addressed by this Negotiating Group.

Environmental goods

Paragraph 31 (iii) of the Doha Ministerial Declaration foresees that negotiations be held “on the reduction or, as appropriate, elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods …”. At the first meeting of the Committee on Trade and Environment Special Session, held in March 2002, there was broad support for the idea that the negotiations on environmental goods be conducted by the Negotiating Group on Market Access.

Special and Differential treatment

Capacity-building measures

The Secretariat organized a “Market Access Seminar” in May 2002 in order to identify better the issues under negotiations. Three issues in particular were discussed: Tariffs, NTBs and Databases.

Appropriate studies prepared by the Secretariat

As requested by the Members, the Secretariat has prepared different technical studies in order to address the issues under negotiation.

tariffs,Reports,World Trade Organization (WTO),https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/agric_e/agnegs_swissformula_e.htm,Agriculture - tariff reduction methods,,,"> Back to the agriculture negotiations backgrounder This briefing document explains current agricultural issues raised before and in the current negotiations. It has been prepared by the Information and Media Relations Division of the WTO Secretariat to help public understanding about the agriculture negotiations. It is not an official record of the negotiations.

This backgrounder explains some of the main methods that are based on formulas, and compares them. Although it contains some algebra, it is kept as simple as possible, with the aim of providing nothing more than a taste of the various methods. (Considerably more technical detail and a wider range of approaches can be found in WTO document TN/MA/S/3/Rev.2 , Formula Approaches to Tariff Negotiations (revision), 11 April 2003, prepared by the Secretariat for the non-agricultural market access negotiations.

Single rate: Tariffs are cut to a single rate for all products. Theoretically, this is the simplest outcome. In practice it is mainly used in regional free trade agreements where the final tariff rate is zero, or a low tariff, for trade within the group.

Flat-rate percentage reductions: the same percentage reduction for all products, no matter whether the starting tariff is high or low. For example, all tariffs cut by 25% in equal steps over five years.



Uruguay Round approach: The 1986-94 Uruguay Round negotiations in agriculture produced an agreement for developed countries to cut tariffs on agricultural products by an average of 36% over six years (6% per year) with a minimum of 15% on each product for the period.

Harmonizing reductions. These are designed principally to make steeper cuts on higher tariffs, bringing the final tariffs closer together (to harmonize the rates):

Different percentages for different tariff bands. For example, no cuts for tariffs between 0 and 10%, 25% cuts for tariffs between 11% and 50%, 50% cuts for tariffs above that, etc. A variation could include scrapping all tariffs below 5% which are sometimes seen as a nuisance with little benefit. These could be simple or average reductions within each band.

For example, no cuts for tariffs between 0 and 10%, 25% cuts for tariffs between 11% and 50%, 50% cuts for tariffs above that, etc. A variation could include scrapping all tariffs below 5% which are sometimes seen as a nuisance with little benefit. These could be simple or average reductions within each band. Mathematical formulas designed to make steeper cuts (i.e. higher percentage cuts) on higher tariffs. One example is the so-called Swiss formula (more below).

Other methods. There are a number of possibilities:

Different rates for different categories of products. For example steeper cuts on processed products than on raw materials. This is an attempt to deal with tariff escalation, where countries protect their processing industries by making imported raw materials cheap and imported processed products expensive.

For example steeper cuts on processed products than on raw materials. This is an attempt to deal with tariff escalation, where countries protect their processing industries by making imported raw materials cheap and imported processed products expensive. Combinations of any of these.





THE URUGUAY ROUND APPROACH > back to top

Example using 36% average cuts over six years (6% per year)

Negotiate a specified average percentage reduction in tariffs over a specified number of years with the flexibility of a smaller minimum reduction for individual products This was the approach eventually adopted in the 198694 Uruguay Round agriculture negotiations.

The approach has two features:

the flat-rate percentage reductions lead to gentler cuts on high tariffs and a broader range of final tariffs than a harmonizing method such as the Swiss formula (see chart);

the combination of average and minimum reduction figures allows countries the flexibility to vary their actual tariff reductions on individual products (technically described as tariff lines)  even if the average cut is 36%, some cuts will be more, some will be less, and it is possible that no single tariff is actually reduced by that amount.

The chart and table below show that where tariffs start high the final rates are still quite high: a 36% reduction from 150% leaves a final rate of 96% in year 6. Only when the starting tariffs are low do the final tariffs have rates close to the Swiss formula (as in the example): if the tariffs start at 10% and 25%, the rates in year 6 are 6.4% and 16%. The range of final tariffs, from 6.4% to 96%, remains wide.



The 36% figure is one used in the Uruguay Round, although the Uruguay Round approach could use different figures. However it was for average tariff reductions  36% over six years, for developed countries, with a separate average target of 24% over 10 years for developing countries.

THE SWISS FORMULA

A SPECIAL CASE OF A HARMONIZING FORMULA TARIFF CUT

Back to top

Negotiate a much narrower gap between high and low tariffs

with a built-in maximum tariff Greatly narrowing the gap between high and low tariffs is called harmonizing the tariffs. The Swiss formula is a special kind of harmonizing method. It uses a single mathematical formula to produce:

a narrow range of final tariff rates from a wide set of initial tariffs

a maximum final rate, no matter how high the original tariff was.

Usually the required cuts are then divided into equal annual steps.



The forumula was proposed by Switzerland in the 197379 Tokyo Round negotiations. But Switzerland opposes using this method in the current agriculture negotiations; it prefers the Uruguay Round approach, while Uruguay prefers the Swiss formula!



A key feature is a number, which is negotiated and plugged into the formula. It is known as a coefficient (A in the formula below). This also determines the maximum final tariff rate.



The formula

Z = AX/(A+X)

where

X = initial tariff rate

A = coefficient and maximum tariff rate

Z = resulting lower tariff rate (end of period)

From the formula, Z=AX/(A+X),

as the initial tariff X rises to infinity, X/(A+X) approaches 1,

resulting in Z=Ax1.

Tariff cuts

Developed countries tariff cuts were for the most part phased in over five years from 1 January 1995. The result is a 40% cut in their tariffs on industrial products, from an average of 6.3% to 3.8%. The value of imported industrial products that receive duty-free treatment in developed countries will jump from 20% to 44%.

There will also be fewer products charged high duty rates. The proportion of imports into developed countries from all sources facing tariffs rates of more than 15% will decline from 7% to 5%. The proportion of developing country exports facing tariffs above 15% in industrial countries will fall from 9% to 5%.

The Uruguay Round package has been improved. On 26 March 1997, 40 countries accounting for more than 92% of world trade in information technology products, agreed to eliminate import duties and other charges on these products by 2000 (by 2005 in a handful of cases). As with other tariff commitments, each participating country is applying its commitments equally to exports from all WTO members (i.e. on a most-favoured-nation basis), even from members that did not make commitments.

More bindings

Developed countries increased the number of imports whose tariff rates are bound (committed and difficult to increase) from 78% of product lines to 99%. For developing countries, the increase was considerable: from 21% to 73%. Economies in transition from central planning increased their bindings from 73% to 98%. This all means a substantially higher degree of market security for traders and investors.

And agriculture ...

Tariffs on all agricultural products are now bound. Almost all import restrictions that did not take the form of tariffs, such as quotas, have been converted to tariffs  a process known as tariffication. This has made markets substantially more predictable for agriculture. Previously more than 30% of agricultural produce had faced quotas or import restrictions. The first step in tariffication was to replace these restrictions with tariffs that represented about the same level of protection. Then, over six years from 1995-2000, these tariffs were gradually reduced (the reduction period for developing countries ends in 2005). The market access commitments on agriculture also eliminate previous import bans on certain products.

In addition, the lists include countries commitments to reduce domestic support and export subsidies for agricultural products. (See section on agriculture.)"

Introduction

The Information Technology Agreement was concluded in December 1996 at the first WTO Ministerial Conference held in Singapore.

World exports of ITA products have more than quadrupled since 1996, reaching USD 2.5 trillion in 2021.

The export of products under the expansion of the ITA, agreed in 2015, is estimated at about USD 2.1 trillion.

Information Technology Agreement — introduction

The mandate of the ITA is to eliminate and bind customs duties and other duties and charges (ODCs) at zero for around 200 IT products as listed in the Annex of the Ministerial Declaration, ensuring duty-free trade among WTO members. This commitment is incorporated into WTO members' schedules of concessions and applied on a most-favoured nation (MFN) basis, meaning even non-participants benefit from the tariff eliminations. The ITA also includes provisions for expanding product coverage and addressing non-tariff barriers to reflect technological advancements and evolving trade needs.

What is a request for consultations?

The request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the WTO. Consultations give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter and to find a satisfactory solution without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel."

Increased tariffs—including those that took effect this week—will dampen trade in the second half of 2025 and in 2026 (see Chart 1 and Table 1).

Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said: ""Global trade has shown resilience in the face of persistent shocks, including recent tariff hikes. Frontloaded imports and improved macroeconomic conditions have provided a modest lift to the 2025 outlook. However, the full impact of recent tariff measures is still unfolding. The shadow of tariff uncertainty continues to weigh heavily on business confidence, investment and supply chains. Uncertainty remains one of the most disruptive forces in the global trading environment.""

""Nevertheless, it is important that a broader cycle of tit-for-tat retaliation that could be very damaging to global trade has so far been avoided. The WTO Secretariat will continue to monitor developments closely, including further work on the impact of the latest tariff measures on the share of global trade conducted under Most Favoured Nation (MFN) principles. Work will also continue with members to safeguard the stability and predictability so essential to the world’s trading system.""

Asian economies are projected to remain the largest positive driver of world merchandise trade volume growth in 2025, although their contribution in 2026 will be smaller than predicted in April (Chart 1). North America will weigh negatively on global trade growth in both 2025 and 2026, but its negative impact this year will be smaller than previously estimated due to stronger-than-expected frontloading of imports in the US in the first quarter. Meanwhile, Europe's contribution to trade in 2025 has gone from moderately positive to slightly negative. Other regions, including economies whose exports are largely energy products, will see their positive contribution to trade growth shrink between 2025 and 2026 as lower oil prices reduce export revenues and dampen import demand.

Table 1 summarizes the current outlook for trade by region. North America's imports are expected to decline by 8.3% in 2025, less than the 9.6% drop foreseen in the April forecast. This positive impact was matched by a stronger-than-expected 4.9% rise in exports of Asia, up from 1.6% in the previous forecast. Europe's export and import growth this year of -0.9% and 0.4% respectively will be slightly weaker than we predicted in April while North America's exports will be less negative (‑4.2%).

The -0.2% projected trade contraction for 2025 in the April forecast was based on measures in place at that time (14 April), including the suspension of ""reciprocal"" tariffs by the United States. Subsequent US agreements with China and the United Kingdom raised the forecast for the year to 0.3%, but higher tariffs on steel and aluminium later brought it back down to 0.1%. The higher tariffs that came into force on 7 August will weigh increasingly on trade, but this will be balanced against positive impacts from frontloading and inventory accumulation, which will have to be unwound at some point. Positive tailwinds have also come from an improved macroeconomic climate, although this is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.

Components of interim updated forecast

On balance, the forecast for merchandise trade growth in 2025 has improved to 0.9%, which can be broken down into two positive factors and one negative one.

First, US imports surged in the first half of 2025, up 11% year-on-year in volume terms, due to frontloading and inventory accumulation. This rise included a sharp 14% quarter-on-quarter increase in Q1 followed by a 16% drop in Q2 (on a seasonally adjusted basis). Moving imports forward to Q1 should result in lower import demand in the future. This correction is expected to come in the second half of 2025, but some will occur only in 2026 and beyond. Hence, this factor will temporarily boost the outlook for 2025 trade. This frontloading factor contributes most to the updated forecast. It is worth noting that a similar, though less extreme, pattern can be seen in imports of other countries, possibly driven by fears of retaliation.

Second, the global macroeconomic outlook is now more favourable than many economists expected back in April. Contributing to the improved climate has been the depreciation of the US dollar against other currencies, which should ease financial conditions for developing economies. Falling oil prices should also support growth in manufacturing economies, although it may simultaneously reduce import demand in oil producing regions.

Third, recent tariff changes are expected to have an overall negative impact on the outlook for global trade compared to the April forecast. This stems from a combination of factors. On the one hand, the US-China truce and exemptions for motor vehicles are contributing positively; on the other hand, higher ""reciprocal"" tariff rates introduced on 7 August are expected to weigh increasingly on imports in the United States and depress exports of its trading partners in the second half of 2025 and in 2026."
tariffs,Reports,World Trade Organization (WTO),https://www.wto.org/english/blogs_e/ce_ralph_ossa_e/blog_ro_11apr25_e.htm,"In a world of trade tensions, what do tariffs really do?","Ralph Ossa, Chief Economist",,"Trade policy tensions are escalating fast. In recent months, several large economies have announced or implemented sweeping new tariffs, reviving a policy tool that many thought to have been largely relegated to the past. These developments have sparked a flurry of political commentary — but behind the headlines, there exists a body of economic research that helps to make sense of what tariffs actually do.

At their core, tariffs are simple: they raise the domestic price of imported goods. But their effects ripple through the economy in complex ways — altering prices, wages, exchange rates and trade patterns. As governments revisit this powerful lever, understanding the economic mechanisms at play has never been more important.

At the most basic level, a tariff is a tax on imported products. It drives a wedge between the world price and the domestic price. For instance, if a 10 per cent tariff is imposed on a product with a world price of US$ 100, the domestic price becomes US$ 110. The difference — US$ 10 — is collected as tariff revenue, which the government can use to finance its expenditures.

Tariffs can also affect the world price of a product, particularly when they are imposed by a large economy. The logic is that higher domestic prices reduce domestic demand, which in turn lowers world demand, and thus world prices. In our example, the world price might fall to $95 after the tariff is imposed, resulting in a domestic price of $104.50. In this case, part of the tariff is effectively paid by foreign producers.

This cost-shifting creates incentives for large economies to unilaterally impose tariffs. However, this so-called optimal tariff argument overlooks the possibility of retaliation. If country A imposes tariffs on country B, country B has an incentive to respond in kind. The end result is a trade war that leaves both sides worse off.

This logic underpins the leading theory of trade negotiations. If all economies attempt to benefit at each other’s expense, everyone ends up worse off — and this creates incentives for cooperative trade policymaking. The economics literature on trade policy has shown that the core WTO principles of reciprocity and non-discrimination are effective tools for escaping the logic of mutually harmful tariffs (Bagwell and Staiger, 2002).

The extent to which tariffs pass through to consumer prices is ultimately an empirical question. Evidence from the initial wave of US tariffs on China suggests full pass-through to US consumers (Amiti et al. 2019; Fajgelbaum et al. 2019). However, these studies focus on short-term effects and use methodologies that cannot fully account for broader macroeconomic adjustments. Standard quantitative trade models typically predict at least some cost-shifting to foreign producers.

A broader question is how tariffs affect inflation. When a country imposes a tariff, it causes a one-off increase in the domestic price level, but this does not necessarily translate into sustained inflation. One channel through which a tariff could lead to persistent inflation is a wage–price spiral, which is similar to what can happen with other supply shocks.

Tariffs do not just affect imports – they also affect exports. One direct channel is through higher prices for intermediate goods, which undermine the competitiveness of exporting firms; but broader general equilibrium effects are also important. Tariffs allow import-competing sectors to expand, which draws resources — such as labour, capital and land — away from other sectors, including exporting sectors.

This process operates through changes in the real exchange rate, which measures domestic prices relative to foreign prices, adjusted for the nominal exchange rate. As import-competing sectors expand, they demand more workers, which pushes up wages across the economy. Higher wages raise production costs for exporting firms, making them less competitive in international markets. The result is an appreciation of the real exchange rate, which makes exports relatively more expensive abroad.

A related question is what happens to the nominal exchange rate. One channel is direct: tariffs reduce import demand, and hence the demand for foreign currency, leading to an appreciation of the domestic currency. Another channel is indirect: tariffs may lead markets to anticipate tighter monetary policy to counter inflation, which can also cause the domestic currency to appreciate. For trade effects, what ultimately matters is the change in the real exchange rate; whether this occurs through adjustments in wages, domestic prices, or the nominal exchange rate is of secondary importance.

There is, thus, a trade-off between the inflationary and competitiveness effects of tariffs. If the exchange rate appreciates strongly, domestic prices rise little, but competitiveness suffers significantly. If it appreciates only slightly, domestic prices rise more, but competitiveness is less affected. Either way, tariffs impose economic costs.

A topical question is whether tariffs affect trade imbalances. The answer depends on whether one considers aggregate, bilateral or sectoral imbalances. Aggregate trade imbalances reflect the gap between national saving and national investment — a basic accounting identity. The logic is analogous to household finance: if a household (country) saves, it must earn (export) more than it spends (imports).

To improve the aggregate trade balance, tariffs would need to increase national saving or reduce investment, which is a possibility. For instance, households might delay consumption if they expect tariffs to be temporary, thereby raising saving. Alternatively, tariffs could reduce investment by increasing the cost of capital goods, or by creating policy uncertainty, leading firms to postpone spending.

However, most economists expect tariffs to have only limited effects on aggregate imbalances. Macroeconomic fundamentals — such as fiscal policy or the household savings rate — play a more dominant role. This view is supported by empirical studies that have found little impact of tariffs on aggregate trade balances so far (Furceri et al. 2022).

Tariffs can, however, affect bilateral trade balances by altering relative prices. It is entirely possible for country A to run a deficit with country B, B with C, and C with A — without any of them having an aggregate trade imbalance.

Tariffs can also affect sectoral trade balances. For example, higher tariffs on goods imports tend to improve the goods trade balance by discouraging imports through higher domestic prices, while worsening the services trade balance by reducing services exports through an appreciation of the real exchange rate.

As tariffs return to the trade policy agenda, it is worth recalling what economics has long understood: tariffs are not just a tool for raising revenue or protecting domestic industries — they are a policy lever with wide-ranging, and often unintended, consequences. Their appeal in the short term can obscure longer-term costs to inflation, competitiveness and international cooperation. In a world of growing trade tensions, a clear-eyed view of those trade-offs is more important than ever."
